# File names and locations for Windows Server technical articles

Knowing and following the rules helps you get your pull request accepted faster.

+ [Rules]
+ [Pattern]
+ [File name approval]

## Rules

- All files must be in markdown and use the .md file extension.
- Keep the file names to 3-5 words if possible - 10 words is really too long for readability and SEO.
- Use lower case and only letters, numbers, and hyphens.
- No spaces or punctuation characters. Use a hyphen to separate words and numbers in the file name.
- Use the short form of action verbs, not the '-ing' form: `deploy-nano-server` not `Deploying-Nano-Server`
- Leave out small words, such as a, and, the, in, or.
- Spell words out; avoid unapproved or unnecessary acronyms in file names
- File names should be unique - instead of `overview.md` use `storage-spaces-overview.md`

Acronyms and initialisms in file names - specific guidelines:

- Follow existing Microsoft guidance for acceptable name abbreviations
- Industry-standard abbreviations are acceptable as necessary in file names.

## Pattern

Review the list of articles in the repository to get an idea of existing names. Here's the general pattern:

 **component-topic-title.md**
 
For example, `storage-spaces-direct-overview.md`

## File name approval

When you submit a new file, pull request reviewers review the name and provide feedback via the pull request comment stream if changes are needed. The file name needs to be corrected before the pull request is accepted. Contributors can easily push the update to the pending pull request.

## Folders in the repo

Use the existing folder structure. Don't create folders without getting approval from a repository admin. Talk to them if you think you need a new folder.

The GitHub repository should have a simple and relatively flat folder structure – \<area>\\\<technology> - for example storage\data-deduplication. Doing so has the following advantages:
 - It’s very simple.
 - It’s closer to how Azure.com works
 - It makes it easy for writers/PMs to quickly find their topics – no need to dig around through other folders looking for where a particular technology is nested.
 - It keeps the URL short, which is good for SEO and user experience, customers occasionally look at the URL for cues.

## Changing case in file names

Windows operating systems are case insensitive. If you need to change a file name to fix casing, it's better to make a change to the file contents, unless you're on a Linux or Mac. For example:

  biztalk-administration-and-Development-Task-List-in-BizTalk-Services --> biztalk-services-administration-and-development-task-list

Use the `git mv` command to rename a file:
```
  git mv <WindowsServerDocs/tech-area/subarea/current-file-name.md> <WindowsServerDocs/tech-area/subarea/new-file-name.md>
```
