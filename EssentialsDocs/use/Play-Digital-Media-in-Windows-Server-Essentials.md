# Play Digital Media in Windows Server Essentials

>Applies To: Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

Digital media refers to audio, video, and photo content that has been digitally compressed.  Windows Server Essentials makes it possible for networked computers and some networked digital media devices to play digital media files that are stored on the server.

 The following topics provide information about accessing and playing digital media files that are stored on  Windows Server Essentials:

##  <a name="BKMK_1"></a> Digital media overview
 Digital media refers to audio, video, and photo content that has been encoded (digitally compressed). Encoding content involves converting audio and video input to a digital media file such as a Windows Media file. After digital media is encoded, it can be easily manipulated, distributed, and played by computers, and it is easily transmitted over computer networks.

 Examples of digital media types include: Windows Media Audio (WMA), Windows Media Video (WMV), MP3, JPEG, and AVI. For information about the digital media types that are supported by Windows Media Player, see [File types supported by Windows Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/316992).

### Why would I want to stream my digital media?
 Many people store music, video, and pictures in shared folders in  Windows Server Essentials. There may be times when you want to do following:

-   **Watch videos**. Your server can be used to store and stream large collections of videos and recorded TV shows to your computers or other playback devices on your network. You can stream videos to an Xbox 360 or to a computer by using Windows Media Player.

-   **Play music**. When you turn on Media Sharing for the **Music** shared folder, you can access your music from devices that support Windows Media Connect. You do not need to enable or configure any user accounts to stream from the **Music** shared folder after sharing is turned on.

-   **Present photo slide shows**. You can store your digital photos in the **Photos** shared folder on your server and then access them from any computer or from an Xbox 360 that is connected to a TV in your home or office. You can watch photo slide shows, which is like turning your TV into a large picture frame.

### Sharing copy-protected media
  Windows Server Essentials does not support sharing copy-protected media. This includes music that is purchased through an online music store.

 Copy-protected media can be played back only on the computer or device that you used to purchase it. Copy protection prevents you from playing media on more than one computer or device, even if you copy the media to your server and play it from there. However, you can store the copy-protected media on  Windows Server Essentials and continue to play back the media on the computer or device that you used to purchase it.

##  <a name="BKMK_2"></a> Play and share digital media
 After you set up your network and successfully connect your computers and media devices to the server network, you can search for any digital media files that you store and share on the server.

> [!NOTE]
>  For a current list of digital media player/receive devices that are compatible with  Windows Server Essentials, see the [Windows Compatibility Center](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home).

Other users can add media files to the server by using the **Shared Folders** connection on the Launchpad, by using the  Remote Web Access site, or by using the My Server app for Windows Phone. For information about playing media, see [Play and share digital media](Play-Digital-Media-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_2).

> [!NOTE]
>  You can also upload media files to the server by using the My Server app for Windows Phone. You can download the My Server app from the [Windows Phone store](http://www.windowsphone.com/store/app/my-server/6c2f98d5-6fcf-4e1d-b8b1-cde62ea1a94a). For more information about the My Server app for Windows Phone, see the blog post [My Server phone app for Windows Server Essentials](/archive/blogs/sbs/my-server-phone-app-for-windows-server-2012-essentials).

#### To add digital media files to shared folders on the server

1.  Use one of the following methods to sign in to the server:


    1.  For information about logging on to Remote Web Access, see [Use Remote Web Access](Use-Remote-Web-Access-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).

    1.  For information about logging on to Remote Web Access, see [Use Remote Web Access](../use/Use-Remote-Web-Access-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).


    2.  For information about signing in with Launchpad, see [Launchpad Overview](../manage/Overview-of-the-Launchpad-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).

2.  Search for and click the folder for the media that you are adding.

3.  Copy and paste, or drag-and-drop the media files that you want to add to the appropriate shared folder on the server.

##  <a name="BKMK_5"></a> Download format options
 There are two options for downloading files. These options are available only when you are downloading multiple files or a folder to a Windows-based computer.

 Choose the following option that fits your needs for downloads:

- **Compressed ZIP file (.zip)**

   Zipping a file creates a compressed version of the file that is smaller than the original file. The zipped version of the file has a .zip file name extension. File types that are reduced the most by zipping are text-oriented file types (such as .txt, .doc, and .xls), and graphics files that use non-compressed file types (such as .bmp). Some graphic files, such as .jpg and .gif files, already use compression, and the file size is reduced very little by zipping. Also, a Word document that contains a lot of graphics is not reduced as much as a document that is mostly text.

  > [!NOTE]
  >  This option provides limited support for international file names.

- **Self-extracting executable file (.exe)**

   A self-extracting executable file is a file that you can download that combines the decompression (executable) program with the compressed files. When you run the executable program, it automatically decompresses the compressed files. This is a common way to distribute compressed data without worrying about whether the recipient has the right decompression utility.

  > [!NOTE]
  >  This option supports Unicode characters.

  Before the actual download begins, the .exe or .zip file is created. Depending on the number of files and the total size of the files to be downloaded, this may take several minutes. After the download file is created, downloading the file occurs in the background. This allows you to continue working while the download process completes.

##  <a name="BKMK_6"></a> Easy File Upload tool
 The Easy File Upload tool streamlines the process of uploading files on your  Windows Server Essentials server. You can add as many files as you want to the Easy File Upload tool, and then upload them to the Shared Folders on the  Windows Server Essentials server in a single batch. For more information, see the blog post [Understanding Remote Web Access File Sharing](/archive/blogs/sbs/understanding-remote-web-access-file-sharing).

##  <a name="BKMK_7"></a> View and browse shared digital media
 You can view or browse resources either by using the Dashboard, the Launchpad, the Remote Web Access website, or the My Server app for Windows Phone.

#### To view and browse shared media from the Dashboard
