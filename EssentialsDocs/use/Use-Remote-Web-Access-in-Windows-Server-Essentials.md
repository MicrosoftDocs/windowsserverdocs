# Use Remote Web Access in Windows Server Essentials

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

  Remote Web Access is a feature of Windows Servers Essentials that enables you to access file/folders and computers on your network via a web browser from anywhere with Internet connectivity.

  Remote Web Access helps you stay connected to your Windows Server Essentials network when you are away. When you log on to Remote Web Access, you can connect to the computers on your Windows Server Essentials network, open the Dashboard to manage your Windows Server Essentials network, and access all of the shared folders and media files on the server.

 This topic includes the following sections:

###  <a name="BKMK_1"></a> Log on to Remote Web Access
 When you log on to  Remote Web Access from a local or remote computer, you can access resources on your server running Windows Server Essentials and computers on your network.

##### To log on to Remote Web Access from a network computer

1.  Open a Web browser, type **https://**_<YourServerName\>_**/remote** in the address bar, and then press Enter.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  Make sure that you include the s in https.

2.  On the  Remote Web Access logon page, type your user name and password in the text boxes, and then click the arrow.

##### To log on to Remote Web Access from a remote computer

1.  Open a Web browser, type **https://**_<YourDomainName\>_**/remote** in the address bar, and then press Enter.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can get your domain name information from your network administrator. Make sure that you include the s in https.

2.  On the  Remote Web Access logon page, type your user name and password in the text boxes, and then click the arrow.

###  <a name="BKMK_1.5"></a> Remotely access your computer
 When you are away from your office, you can use your Web browser to log on to the  Remote Web Access site to remotely access your Windows Server Essentials Dashboard, shared folders, and computers on your network.

 When you connect to the Dashboard, you can manage Windows Server Essentials just like you would if you were at the office. You can perform all of the usual administrative tasks, such as adding user accounts, adding shared folders, setting shared folder access, and so on. When you connect to computers on your network, you can access their desktops as if you were sitting in front of them at the office.

 The **Status** column shows you if you can connect to a computer on your network, and can include the following values:

-   **Available**

     The computer is turned on and is available for a remote connection. Even if you see this status, you still may not be able to connect to this computer if a third-party firewall blocks the connection.

-   **Offline or Sleeping**

     The computer is turned off or is in Sleep or Hibernate mode. If a computer is offline or sleeping, the status is updated in real time so that you can know when the computer becomes available.

-   **Unsupported operating system**

     The operating system on the computer does not support Remote Desktop. It may take up to 6 hours for this status to be updated on the server if there is a change.

-   **Connection is disabled**

     The computer connection is either blocked by a firewall, or the remote desktop is disabled on the computer or by Group Policy. It may take up to 6 hours for this status to be updated on the server if there is a change.

#### To connect to a computer on your network
 On the **DEVICES** tab, click the name of the computer. You can select only computers with an **Available** status.

#### To connect to the server Dashboard
 On the **DEVICES** tab, click the name of your server. You can select only computers with an **Available** status. You must be able to provide an administrator user account and password on your server to use the Dashboard.

#### Upload files

##### To upload files

1. In Remote Web Access, click the **Shared Folders** tab, and then click a shared-folder link. A list of the files and folders in that shared folder is displayed.

2. From the shared-folder list of files and folders, click the folder where you want to upload the file to, and then click **Upload**.

3. If the standard upload tool is not already loaded, click **Use the standard upload method**.

4. Click **Browse**  to find a file on your computer.

5. Navigate through the folders on your computer to find the file that you want to upload, and then click **Open**.

6. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each file that you want to upload.

7. When you have added all of the files that you want to upload, click **Upload**.

   The Easy File Upload tool streamlines the process of uploading files on your server running Windows Server Essentials. You can add as many files as you want to the Easy File Upload tool by using the drag-and-drop feature, and then upload them to the shared folders on the server.

> [!NOTE]
>  Uploading of multiple files is natively supported in web browsers that are compatible with HTML5. This tool is only necessary when the web browser does not support HTML5.

##### To upload files using the Easy File Upload tool

1.  In Remote Web Access, click the **Shared Folders** tab, and then click a shared-folder link. A list of the files and folders in that shared folder is displayed.

2.  From the shared-folder list of files and folders, click the folder where you want to upload the files to, and then click **Upload**. If the folder that you want to upload to does not exist, click **New folder**, type the name of the new folder in the dialog box, and then click **OK**.

3.  You may need to run the Windows Server Solutions add-on. If so, click in the yellow strip at the top of the screen, click run **Add-on**, and then click **Run** in the dialog box.

4.  If the Easy File Upload tool is not already loaded, click **Use the Easy File Upload tool**.

6.  When you finish adding the files that you want to upload to the selected folder, click **Upload**.

7.  When the files are uploaded successfully, click **Close**.

#### Download files or folders

##### To download a single file

1. In Remote Web Access, click the **Shared Folders** tab, and then click a shared-folder link. A list of the files and folders in that shared folder is displayed.

2. From the shared-folder file list, click the check box next to the file that you want to download to your home computer.

3. Click **Download** to begin the download.

4. On the **File Download** dialog box, click **Save** to save the file to your computer.

5. In the **Save As** dialog box, select the location to save the file, and then click **Save**. A single file is not compressed before it is downloaded.

   There are two options for downloading multiple files or folders. Choose the option that fits your needs:

> [!NOTE]
>  These options are available only when you are downloading multiple files or folders to your computer.

- **Self-extracting executable file (.exe)**

  > [!NOTE]
  >   This section applies to a server running Windows Server Essentials.

   A self-extracting executable file is a file that you can download that combines the decompression (executable) program with the compressed files. When you run the executable program, it automatically decompresses the compressed files (self-extracting). This is a common way to distribute compressed data without worrying about whether the recipient has the right decompression utility.

  > [!NOTE]
  >  This option supports Unicode characters.

- **Windows Compressed folder (.zip)**

   Zipping a file creates a compressed version of the file that is smaller than the original file. The zipped version of the file has a .zip file name extension. File types that are reduced the most by zipping are text-oriented file types, such as .txt, .doc, .xls, and graphics files that use non-compressed file types such as .bmp. Some graphic files, such as .jpg and .gif files, already use compression, and the file size is reduced very little by zipping. Also, a Word document that contains a lot of graphics is not reduced as much as a document that is mostly text.

  > [!NOTE]
  >  This option provides limited support for international file names in  Windows Server Essentials.

  Before the actual download begins, the exe or zip file is created. Depending on the number of files and the total size of the files to be downloaded, this may take several minutes. After the download file is created, downloading the file occurs in the background. This allows you to continue working while the download process completes.

##### To download multiple files or folders

1.  In Remote Web Access, click the **Shared Folders** tab, and then click a shared-folder link. A list of the files and folders in that shared folder is displayed.

2.  From the shared-folder file list, click the check box next to the files or folders that you want to download to your home computer.

3.  Click **Download** to begin the download.

4.  In the **Choose a Download Format** dialog box, click to select the download format option that you prefer, and then click **OK**. The compressed file is prepared in the format option that you selected.

5.  In the **File Download** dialog box, click **Save** to save the file to your computer.

6.  In the **Save As** dialog box, select the location to save the file, and then click **Save**.

#### Retrieve compressed files downloaded to your computer

> [!NOTE]
>   This section applies to a server running Windows Server Essentials.

 If you select multiple files or folders to download, you can receive a self-extracting compressed executable file (.exe) or a compressed (.zip) file.

##### To retrieve a file from the compressed (.exe) file

1.  On your computer, double-click the compressed file to open it.

2.  Follow the instructions to extract the files to a folder on your computer.

##### To retrieve a file from the compressed (.zip) file

1.  On your computer, double-click the compressed file to open it.

2.  Select the files that you want to retrieve, and then drag the files to a folder on your computer where you want to store them.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you use a third-party file compression program, follow the procedures for that program to extract your files from the compressed file.
