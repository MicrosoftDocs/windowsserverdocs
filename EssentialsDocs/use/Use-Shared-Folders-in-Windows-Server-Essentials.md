# Use Shared Folders in Windows Server Essentials

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials
  
 Windows Server Essentials provides a central location for all of your data and files through the shared folders that are located on your server.  
  
 There are several different ways that you can access your shared folders on Windows Server Essentials from a device that is connected to the server:  
  

-   [Using the Windows Server Essentials Launchpad](Use-Shared-Folders-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_UsingLaunchpad)  
  
-   [Using Remote Web Access](Use-Shared-Folders-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_UsingRWA)  
  
-   [Using My Server app for Windows Phone](Use-Shared-Folders-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Phone)  
  
-   [Using My Server app for Windows 8](Use-Shared-Folders-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_App)  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_UsingLaunchpad"></a> Using the Windows Server Essentials Launchpad  
 You can use the Launchpad from any computer that is connected to the server by using the Connect My Computer to the Server Wizard. For more information about connecting your computer to the server, see [Connect computers to the server](Get-Connected-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_9).

-   [Using My Server app for Windows Phone](../use/Use-Shared-Folders-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Phone)  
  
-   [Using My Server app for Windows 8](../use/Use-Shared-Folders-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_App)

 You can use the Launchpad from any computer that is connected to the server by using the Connect My Computer to the Server Wizard. For more information about connecting your computer to the server, see [Connect computers to the server](../use/Get-Connected-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_9).  

  
 After you connect your computer to the server, a Launchpad shortcut is added to the notification area of your desktop. Double-click the Launchpad icon and enter your network credentials to access shared folders by using the Launchpad. Using the shared folders link on the Launchpad, you can upload or download files to any of the shared folders that are listed by dragging and dropping files between the local computer and the shared folders. Shared folders enable you to stream music and videos, play slideshows, or record TV programs on any computer that is connected to the server, or you can play a slide show to view pictures.  
  
 For more information about the Launchpad, see [Launchpad Overview](../manage/Overview-of-the-Launchpad-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_Launchpad"></a> Copy or move shared files or folders using the Launchpad  
 When you want to copy or move shared files on Windows Server Essentials by using the Launchpad, click the **Shared Folders** tab in the Launchpad.  
  
 If you want to move a file or folder from one location to another in **Shared Folders**, you can use the drag-and-drop method in the same way as you would move files and folders on your computer. Open the folder that contains the file or folder that you want to move. Then open the folder where you want to move it to in a different window. Position the windows side-by-side on the desktop so that you can see the contents of both, and then drag the file or folder from the first folder to the second folder.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When using the drag-and-drop method, you might notice that sometimes the file or folder is **copied**, and at other times it is **moved**. If you are dragging an item between two folders that are stored on the same hard disk, the item is moved so that two copies of the same file or folder aren't created in the same location. If you drag the item to a folder that is in a different location (such as another computer) or to removable media such as a USB flash drive, the item is copied.  
  
 If you want to copy files or folders from one location to another in **Shared Folders**, you can use the copy and paste method in the same way as you would copy files on your computer. Open the folder that contains the files that you want to copy. Right-click the files that you want to copy, and then click **Copy**. Right-click the folder where you want to paste the copied files, and then click **Paste**.
