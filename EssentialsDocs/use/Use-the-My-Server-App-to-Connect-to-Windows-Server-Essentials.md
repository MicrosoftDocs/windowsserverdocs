# Use the My Server App to Connect to Windows Server Essentials

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

The My Server apps for  Windows Server Essentials let you connect to resources and perform light administrative tasks on your  Windows Server Essentials server from your laptop, PC, or Surface device. In My Server, you can manage users, devices, and alerts, and work with shared files on the server. When you are offline, you can continue to work with files recently accessed in My Server; your offline changes are automatically synchronized with the server the next time you connect.

 If your server is running the  Windows Server Essentials operating system, use the original My Server app. If your server is running the  Windows Server Essentials operating system, you must use the updated My Server 2012 R2 app. Both apps can be downloaded from [Apps for Windows](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-8/apps).

> [!TIP]
>
>  To access resources in  Windows Server Essentials from your Windows Phone, use the My Server phone app (for  Windows Server Essentials) or the My Server 2012 R2 phone app (for  Windows Server Essentials). For information about the My Server phone app, see [Use the My Server app for Windows Phone](Work-Remotely-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_2). For information about the My Server 2012 R2 phone app, see the blog entry [My Server 2012 R2 Windows and Windows Phone apps](/archive/blogs/sbs/my-server-2012-r2-windows-and-windows-phone-apps).

##  <a name="BKMK_OS"></a> Operating system requirements
 To use My Server or My Server 2012 R2 on your laptop, PC, or Surface device, the computer must have one of the following operating systems:  Windows 8.1,  Windows RT 8.1,  Windows 8, or  Windows RT.

##  <a name="BKMK_Install"></a> Install My Server
 You can download the appropriate My Server app from the [Apps for Windows](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-8/apps) store. If your computer has the  Windows 8 or  Windows RT operating system, and you want to connect to the server on your intranet by using the server name, you also need to install a certificate from the server.

#### To install My Server or My Server 2012 R2 on your Windows-based laptop, PC, or Surface device

1.  Install the appropriate My Server app from [Apps for Windows](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-8/apps) onto your Windows-based laptop, PC, or Surface device.

2.  If you want to be able to use the server name to connect to your  Windows Server Essentials server over an intranet, and your device has the  Windows 8 or  Windows RT operating system, install the default CAROOT.cer certificate on your computer by performing the following procedure. Manual installation of a certificate is not needed in  Windows 8.1 and  Windows RT 8.1.

###  <a name="BKMK_InstallCert"></a> To install a certificate for My Server on your Windows 8, Windows 8.1, or Windows RT device

1.  Open a web browser on your computer, and download the default certificate, CAROOT.cer, from the server. To do this, type the following, substituting the name of your server (for example, **marketing.contoso.com**) for <*servername*>:

     **http://<servername\>/connect/default.aspx?get=caroot.cer**

2.  Install the certificate:

    1.  On the **Start** page, open **File Explorer**.

    2.  Ensure that hidden items and file name extensions are displayed: On the **View** tab, in the **Show/hide** group, select the **Hidden items** and **File name extensions** check boxes.

    3.  Navigate to the folder that contains the CAROOT.cer file that you just downloaded.

    4.  Right-click the CAROOT.cer file, and then click **Open**.

    5.  In the **Certificate** dialog box, click **Install Certificate**.

    6.  Select **Local Machine** as the installation location, and then click **Next**.

    7.  On the **Certificate store** wizard page, select **Place all certificates in the following store**, and use **Browse** to choose the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** store. Then click **Finish**.

##  <a name="BKMK_UseServer"></a> Use My Server
 To get started using the My Server or My Server 2012 R2 app, open the app and take a quick tour of its features.

#### To open My Server or My Server 2012 R2

1.  Open My Server (for  Windows Server Essentials) or My Server 2012 R2 (for  Windows Server Essentials) from the **Start** page of your Windows device.

2.  Sign in to the  Windows Server Essentials server using your account on the server. To identify the server:

    -   In an off-premises environment, use the server's domain name - for example, **marketing.contoso.com**.

    -   If you are connecting on-premises over an intranet, use the server name - in the previous example, the server name is **marketing**. (If you are using a  Windows 8 or  Windows RT computer to connect on-premises, and you want to use this method, you must install a CAROOT.cer certificate from the server. For more information, see [To install a certificate for My Server on your Windows 8, Windows 8.1, or Windows RT device](#BKMK_InstallCert).)

###  <a name="BKMK_Features"></a> Features of My Server
 The following table describes the features of the My Server and My Server 2012 R2 apps. Your account type on the server determines what you can see and do. All users can work with shared resources, customize their **Recent** displays, decide how long to cache recently used files for offline access, and turn on or off downloads over paid connections. Administrators on the  Windows Server Essentials server also can manage alerts, devices, and users. Standard user accounts have more limited capabilities for viewing alerts and connecting to devices, determined by properties in the user account; requirements for individual features are noted in the following table.

When you open a file, you must sign in to Microsoft 365 with the Microsoft online account associated with your network account.)<br /><br /> **Note:** To use this feature, the server must be integrated with Microsoft 365, the Microsoft 365 subscription must include SharePoint Online, and your user account on the server must have a Microsoft Online Services account associated with it. For information about integrating Microsoft 365 and SharePoint Online with  Windows Server Essentials, see [Services Integration Overview for Windows Server Essentials - Part 1](/archive/blogs/sbs/services-integration-overview-for-windows-server-2012-r2-essentials-part-1) and [Services Integration Overview for Windows Server Essentials - Part 2](/archive/blogs/sbs/services-integration-overview-for-windows-server-2012-r2-essentials-part-2).|
|Customize your **Recent** display|The **Recent** list gives you quick access to the files that you are working on now. You can make the following changes:<br /><br /> -   Set the number of days of recent file history to display. (**Recent** settings: **Days to keep in Recent**; default = 7 days)<br />-   Clear the **Recent** display, if you no longer need to work the files you have been working with. This does not affect the cache; the files still are available offline. (**Recent** settings: **Clear** button)<br />     **Tip:** If you don't need offline access to the files, use **Clear all** in **Offline** settings to remove the files from the cache.|
|Work offline|By default, files that you have accessed during the past 7 days are available offline. Your offline changes are synchronized with the server whenever you connect to it.<br /><br /> You can make the following changes to your offline configuration:<br /><br /> -   Change the number of days of work to cache. (**Offline** settings in My Server, **Files** settings in My Server 2012 R2: **Caching period**; default = 7 days)<br />-   Allow file transfers over paid networks, or turn off that feature. This feature is turned off by default to prevent expensive file transfers over paid networks. (**Offline** or **Files** settings: **Turn on or off auto-transfer of files over paid networks**; default = **Off**)<br />-   You might occasionally want to clear the cache. Check the size of the cache in **Recent** or **Files** settings; then use **Clear** or **Clear all** to clear the cache.<br /><br /> **Tip:** To find out which files will be available offline, in any shared folder, select the **offline cached** filter instead of **all**.<br /><br /> **Note:** By default, the cache stores the same file history that the **Recent** list displays. Be aware that if you clear the cache, or your settings for the cache and the **Recent** display do not match, some files in the **Recent** list might not be available offline.|
|Background synchronization|Your files are synchronized with the server each time you log on to My Server and when you make changes while connected to the server. To preserve performance, resource-intensive background synchronizations are not performed automatically on most folders. To avoid expensive transfers, background synchronization is not performed on 3 Gigabyte networks.<br /><br /> -   Resolve file conflicts, displayed in the **Conflicting** area of the **Transfer Status** page. When file transfers are being performed, the main screen displays **Transfer Status** and **Alerts** charms.|
