# Work Remotely in Windows Server Essentials

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

 There are multiple ways to access resources that are located on the server when you are away from your network if Anywhere Access functionalities (Remote Web Access, virtual private network, and DirectAccess) are configured on the server.

 The following topics can help you access your server resources remotely:


-   [Use Remote Web Access in Windows Server Essentials](Work-Remotely-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMA_RWA)

-   [Use VPN to connect to Windows Server Essentials](Work-Remotely-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_3)

-   [Use the My Server app to connect to Windows Server Essentials](Work-Remotely-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_App)

-   [Use the My Server app for Windows Phone](Work-Remotely-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_2)

-   [Use Microsoft 365 with Windows Server Essentials](Work-Remotely-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_O365)

> [!NOTE]
>  For information about configuring Anywhere Access on your server, see [Manage Anywhere Access](../manage/Manage-Anywhere-Access-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).

##  <a name="BKMA_RWA"></a> Use Remote Web Access in Windows Server Essentials

 Remote Web Access helps you stay connected to your Windows Server Essentials network when you are away. For more information, see the topic [Use Remote Web Access](Use-Remote-Web-Access-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).


##  <a name="BKMK_3"></a> Use VPN to connect to Windows Server Essentials
 If you have a client computer that is set up with network accounts that can be used to connect to a hosted server running Windows Server Essentials through a VPN connection, all the newly created user accounts on the hosted server must use VPN to log on to the client computer for the first time. Complete the following procedure from the client computer that is connected to the server.

#### To use VPN to remotely access server resources

1.  Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete on the client computer.

2.  Click **Switch User** on the logon screen.

3.  Click the network logon icon on the bottom right corner of the screen.

4.  Log on to the Windows Server Essentials network by using your network user name and password.

##  <a name="BKMK_App"></a> Use the My Server app to connect to Windows Server Essentials
 The My Server app lets you connect to resources and perform light administrative tasks on your  Windows Server Essentials server from your Windows-based PC, laptop, or Surface device. If your server is running  Windows Server 2012, download the original My Server app from [Apps for Windows](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-8/apps). If your server is running  Windows Server Essentials, you must download the My Server 2012 R2 app instead.

 With the expanded My Server 2012 R2 app, you can connect to the server or client computers by using Remote Desktop. If your  Windows Server Essentials server is integrated with  Microsoft 365, and your subscription includes SharePoint Online, you also can work with documents in your SharePoint Online libraries and open your SharePoint team sites from My Server 2012 R2.


 For information about installing and using these apps, see [Use the My Server App](Use-the-My-Server-App-to-Connect-to-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).

##  <a name="BKMK_2"></a> Use the My Server app for Windows Phone
 The My Server Windows app for Windows Phone (for  Windows Server 2012) and the My Server 2012 R2 app for Windows Phone (for  Windows Server Essentials) are designed to help you stay seamlessly connected to your servers through smart phones while working at remote locations. This is one of the various ways to access  Windows Server Essentials after you configure your server for remote access.

 You can download either app from the Windows Phone store:

- [Install My Server for Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/store/app/my-server/6c2f98d5-6fcf-4e1d-b8b1-cde62ea1a94a)

- [Install My Server 2012 R2 for Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/store/app/my-server-2012-r2/44f596b5-0477-4096-b96e-ddd6ef64ad6b)

  For more information about the My Server phone app, see the blog entry [My Server phone app for Windows Server Essentials](/archive/blogs/sbs/my-server-phone-app-for-windows-server-2012-essentials). For more information about the My Server 2012 R2 phone app, see the blog entry [My Server 2012 R2 Windows and Windows Phone apps](/archive/blogs/sbs/my-server-2012-r2-windows-and-windows-phone-apps).

##  <a name="BKMK_O365"></a> Use Microsoft 365 with Windows Server Essentials

 Microsoft 365 is an easy-to-use set of web-enabled tools that let you access your email, important documents, contacts, and calendar from almost anywhere and any device. For more information, see the [Quick Start Guide to Using Microsoft 365](Quick-Start-Guide-to-Using-Microsoft-Office-365-with-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).
