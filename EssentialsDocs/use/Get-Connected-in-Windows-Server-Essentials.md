    4.  To connect the second server to a server running Windows Server Essentials, follow the instructions in [Connect computers to the server](Get-Connected-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_9).


~~~
> [!NOTE]
>  Connecting a second server to a server running Windows Server Essentials differs from connecting to a client computer as follows:
>
>  -   There is no user profile migration; therefore, the current profile will not be migrated.
> -   You cannot back up the second server by using client computer backup, and there is no option to wake up the computer for backup.
~~~

 After you join the second server to a server that is running Windows Server Essentials, the following features are provided to the connected server:

- Update & Alerts status functionalities work the same as other client computers.

- Online & Offline functionalities work the same as other client computers.

- You can connect to your second server by using Remote Web Access.

- The second server will be included in the Health Reports because Windows Server Essentials will generate alerts related to this server.

  Management of the second server from the server that is running Windows Server Essentials will differ from managing other client computers as follows:

- There will be no entrance point for TrayApp, Launchpad, and Dashboard Client.

- The second server is listed within the **Servers** group on the **Devices** tab.

- Because client computer backup is not supported for the second server, the backup status is displayed as **Not supported**. In addition, if you select the second server and right-click, there are no backup and restore related tasks displayed for the second server.

- If you select the second server, and then click the **View the server properties** task, there is no **Backup** tab displayed on the server's properties page.

- Because there is no Security Center on a Windows Server operating system, the second server's security status displays as **Not applicable**.

###  <a name="BKMK_11"></a> Install the Connector software
 The Connector software in Windows Server Essentials is installed when you connect your computer to the server by using the Connect a Computer to the Server Wizard. You can launch this wizard by typing **http://<ServerName\>/connect** in the address bar of your web browser (where *<ServerName\>* is the name of your server).

> [!NOTE]
>  If your computer is at a remote location, to run the Connect a Computer to the Server Wizard, type **http://<domainname\>/connect** in the address bar of your web browser (where *<domain\>* is the domain name of your organization). You can get your domain name information from your network administrator.

 The Connector software does the following:

-   Connects your computer to Windows Server Essentials

-   Automatically backs up your computer nightly (if you configure the server to create client backups)

-   Helps administrator monitor the health of your computer

-   Enables you to configure and remotely administer Windows Server Essentials from your home computer


 For step-by-step instructions about connecting your computer to the Windows Server Essentials server, see [Connect computers to the server](Get-Connected-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_9).


###  <a name="BKMK_12"></a> Move computer data and settings manually
  Windows Server Essentials and  Windows Server Essentials support user profile migration only for client computers that are running the Windows 7 operating system. When you connect a Windows 7-based computer to the server, the Connect Computer to the Server Wizard can automatically migrate the user profile.

 The user profile cannot be transferred automatically when connecting a Windows 8,  Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 computer to the server. However, on a Windows 8 computer, you can use Windows Easy Transfer to transfer data and settings from the original local user to the domain-joined computer. To do that, you must be an Administrator on both the Windows 8 source computer and the Windows 8 destination computer. For information about using Windows Easy Transfer to transfer files and settings, see [article 2735227](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2735227) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

###  <a name="BKMK_Transfer"></a> Transfer multiple user profiles during computer deployment
 Before you connect a computer running the Windows 7 or Windows 7 SP1 operating system to the Windows Server Essentials server, in order to transfer multiple local user profiles you must first create the corresponding network user accounts on the server. For more information about creating network user accounts, see [Add a user account](../manage/Manage-User-Accounts-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Manage1).

 User profile migration is only supported on a computer running Windows 7 (for Windows Server Essentials) or Windows 7 SP1 (for Windows Server Essentials). When you connect a computer to the Windows Server Essentials server using the Connect Your Computer to the Server Wizard, you are provided an option to move the user data and settings of old user local accounts into the new network user accounts. To do so, on the **Move existing user data and settings** page of the wizard, map the network user accounts to the local user accounts that exist on the computer to transfer multiple user profiles that are located on the client computer.

###  <a name="BKMK_13"></a> Uninstall the Connector software
 You can uninstall the Connector software from a computer by using the Control Panel. You will usually do this if there is a problem with the Connector software or if you need to install a newer version of the Connector software. You must be logged on to the computer as an administrator to complete this procedure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If you upgrade the operating system on a client computer, the Connector software is uninstalled automatically. You must reinstall the Connector software after the upgrade is complete. The preferred method is to uninstall the Connector software before you upgrade the operating system. Uninstalling the Connector software after the upgrade is complete is still acceptable; however, it might result in an inconsistent state for the client computer with the server until the Connector software is uninstalled and reinstalled.

##### To uninstall Connector software from a computer

1.  From a computer that is running Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, open **Control Panel**, and then in the **Programs** section, click **View installed updates**.

2.  From the list of installed programs, select **Windows Server Essentials Connector**, and then click **Uninstall**.

3.  On the warning page, click **Yes**.

4.  If the **User Account Control** window appears, click **Allow**.

5.  In Windows Server Essentials, if the Windows Server Essentials Connector page appears suggesting to close the Launchpad, click **OK**.

6.  Wait for the program to uninstall. After the software is removed, **Windows Server Essentials Connector** no longer appears within the list of installed programs or updates. In addition, the shortcuts to the Launchpad and the Dashboard are no longer displayed on the computer's desktop.

> [!NOTE]
> - Uninstalling the Connector software does not remove the computer from the list of computers that are displayed on the **DEVICES** tab of the Dashboard. To remove the computer from the Dashboard, see [Remove a computer from the server](../manage/Manage-Devices-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_3).
>   -   When you uninstall the Connector software, shared folders on the client computer that were mapped to the server are not deleted. You must manually delete the shared folders that are mapped to the server.
>
> -   Uninstalling the Connector software does not make the computer unjoin the original domain. You must manually unjoin the computer from the domain. For instructions, see [Remove a computer from a Windows domain](Get-Connected-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_8).

###  <a name="BKMK_Sleep"></a> How backup works with sleep and hibernate modes
 If you select the **Wake This Computer for Backup** option when you connect a computer to the server, the computer will automatically wake up from sleep or hibernate mode every day as specified in the Backup schedule so that it can be backed up. After the backup is finished, the computer will return to sleep or hibernate mode, based on its power management settings. If you do not select this option, the server will not back up a computer if the computer is sleeping or hibernating. For more information, see [Manage Client Backup](../manage/Manage-Client-Computer-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).

##  <a name="BKMK_C"></a> Use the Launchpad
 You can use the Launchpad to access shared resources from the Windows Server Essentials server, perform computer backups, and respond to system health alerts.
