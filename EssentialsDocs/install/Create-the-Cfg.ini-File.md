# Create the Cfg.ini File

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

The cfg.ini file is used to automate an installation of the operating system in the following scenario:

-   When testing the experience of the end user with a preinstalled image on the target computer, the Initial Configuration section is used to walk through the installation in either an attended or unattended mode. To do this, see [Create the Initial Configuration section](Create-the-Cfg.ini-File.md#BKMK_CreateInit2).

##  <a name="BKMK_CreateInit2"></a> Create the Initial Configuration section
 Use the Initial Configuration section in the cfg.ini file to walk through the installation in either an attended or unattended mode.

#### To define the Initial Configuration section

1.  Open the cfg.ini file in Notepad if it exists; otherwise, create a new file.

2.  Add the following text to create an InitialConfiguration section.

    ```

    [InitialConfiguration]

3.  Save the file. Make sure that you save the file as cfg.ini, not cfg.ini.txt.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can save the file to a USB flash drive, which can be used for specific phases of the installation, or the cfg.ini file can be located at the root of any hard drive on the target server. You must ensure that the encoding for the file is set to ANSI or Unicode, UTF-8 encoding is not supported.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The Initial Configuration section of the cfg.ini should only be used by the end user to personalize the server or for a partner to test the user experience of the server by using an unattended answer file. This section of the file is not intended to be used for creating the image.
