# Create a Bootable USB Flash Drive

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

You can create a bootable USB flash drive to use to deploy  Windows Server Essentials. The first step is to prepare the USB flash drive by using DiskPart, which is a command-line utility. For information about DiskPart, see [DiskPart Command-Line Options](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-vista/cc766465(v=ws.10)).


> [!TIP]
> To create a bootable USB flash drive for use in recovering or reinstalling Windows on a PC instead of a server, see [Create a recovery drive](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026852/windows-create-a-recovery-drive).

 For additional scenarios in which you may want to create or use a bootable USB flash drive, see the following topics:

### To create a bootable USB flash drive

1.  Insert a USB flash drive into a running computer.

2.  Open a Command Prompt window as an administrator.

3.  Type `diskpart`.

4.  In the new command line window that opens, to determine the USB flash drive number or drive letter, at the command prompt, type `list disk`, and then click ENTER. The `list disk` command displays all the disks on the computer. Note the drive number or drive letter of the USB flash drive.

5.  At the command prompt, type `select disk <X>`, where X is the drive number or drive letter of the USB flash drive, and then click ENTER.

6.  Type `clean`, and the click ENTER. This command deletes all data from the USB flash drive.

7.  To create a new primary partition on the USB flash drive, type `create partition primary`, and then click ENTER.

8.  To select the partition that you just created, type `select partition 1`, and then click ENTER.

9. To format the partition, type `format fs=ntfs quick`, and then click ENTER.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  If your server platform supports Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), you should format the USB flash drive as FAT32 rather than as NTFS. To format the partition as FAT32, type `format fs=fat32 quick`, and then click ENTER.

10. Type `active`, and then click ENTER.

11. Type `exit`, and then click ENTER.

12. When you finish preparing your custom image, save it to the root of the USB flash drive.
