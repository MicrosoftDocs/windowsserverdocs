# Add Branding to the Dashboard, Remote Web Access, and Launchpad

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

##  <a name="BKMK_Branding"></a> Add Branding to the Dashboard, Remote Web Access, and Launchpad  
 You can make many branding additions by adding entries in the registry. All branding entries in the registry for the operating system are located under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Server\OEM.  
  
 All co-branding must meet the following logo requirements:  
  
-   The  Windows Server Essentials logo must have a minimum width of **170 pixels**, keeping the correct aspect ratio, with **96 DPI**.  
  
#### To add branding by changing the registry  
  
1.  On the server, move your mouse to the upper right corner of the screen, and click **Search**.  
  
2.  In the Search box, type **regedit**, and then click the **Regedit** application.  
  
3.  In the navigation pane, expand **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE**, expand **SOFTWARE**, expand **Microsoft**, expand **Windows Server**. If the **OEM** key does not exist, complete the following steps to create it:  
  
    1.  Right-click **Windows Server**, click **New**, and then click **Key**.  
  
    2.  Type **OEM** for the name of the key.  
  
4.  (Optional) If you are creating an entry for a logo, you can create different keys to differentiate the language versions of the logo. For example, if you have both English and German versions of a logo, you can create an en-us key and a de-de key. Because all of the logo files are stored in the same folder, you must provide instances of the logo image file with a unique name for each language. For example, you would create a file called DashboardLogo_en.png and DashboardLogo_de.png.  
  
5.  Either right-click **OEM** or right-click the appropriate language key, click to **New**, and then click **String Value**.  
  

6.  Enter the name of the string, and then press ENTER. Refer to the [Registry strings and values](Add-Branding-to-the-Dashboard--Remote-Web-Access--and-Launchpad.md#BKMK_RegStrings) table for the string names and data values.  

6.  Enter the name of the string, and then press ENTER. Refer to the [Registry strings and values](../install/Add-Branding-to-the-Dashboard--Remote-Web-Access--and-Launchpad.md#BKMK_RegStrings) table for the string names and data values.  

  
7.  Right-click the new string, and then click **Modify**.  
  
8.  Enter the value from the table that is associated with the string name, and then click **OK**.  
  
9. If you are creating an entry for a logo image or appended links, copy the file to %programFiles%\Windows Server\Bin\OEM. If the OEM directory does not exist, create it.  
  
10. If changes are made that affect Remote Web Access, after the customer takes possession of the server, they must turn on Remote Web Access. Advise the customer to do the following:  
  
    1.  On the Dashboard, click **Settings**, and then click the **Anywhere Access** tab.  
  
    2.  If Anywhere Access is turned on, click **Configure**, and then clear Remote Web Access checkbox on the **Choose Anywhere Access features to enable** page of the Set up Anywhere Access wizard.  
  
    3.  Click **Configure**.
