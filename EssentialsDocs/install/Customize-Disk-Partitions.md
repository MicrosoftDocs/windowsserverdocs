# Customize Disk Partitions

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

To customize the partition configuration, you can pre-create the image by using an unattend.xml file. It is strongly recommended that a dedicated data partition is used in all configurations to ensure that the server can be easily backed-up and restored.
