# Automate Installation of Add-Ins During Setup

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

##  <a name="BKMK_AddIns"></a> Automate installing add-ins during setup
 To install add-ins during setup, use the PostIC.cmd method described in the [Create the PostIC.cmd File for Running Post Initial Configuration Tasks](Create-the-PostIC.cmd-File-for-Running-Post-Initial-Configuration-Tasks.md) section of this document.

 Add the following entry to your PostIC.cmd:

```
C:\Program Files\Windows Server\bin\Installaddin.exe <full path to wssx file> -q
```

 The add-in now supports pre-install and customized uninstall steps.

 The pre-install step is run before installing all **.msi** files specified in addin.xml. When run in the interactive mode, the progress dialog will be shown but without changing the progress. The cancellation button is disabled during pre-install phase. To implement a pre-install step, add the following contents in addin.xml (directly under Package):

> [!NOTE]
>  The xml schema needs to exactly follow the one below:

```
<Package xmlns="https://schemas.microsoft.com/WindowsServerSolutions/2010/03/Addins" xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <Id>...</Id>
  <Version>...</Version>
  <Name>...</Name>
  <Allow32BitOn64BitClients>...</Allow32BitOn64BitClients>
  <ServerBinary>...</ServerBinary>
  <ClientBinary32>...</ClientBinary32>
  <ClientBinary64>...</ClientBinary64>
  <SupportedSkus>...</SupportUrl>
  <SupportUrl>...</SupportUrl>
  <Location>...</Location>
  <PrivacyStatement>...</PrivacyStatement>
  <OtherBinaries>...</OtherBinaries>
  <Preinstall>
<Executable>exefile</Executable>
<NormalArgs>args-for-interactive-mode</NormalArgs>
<SilentArgs>args-for-silent-mode</SilentArgs>
<IgnoreExitCode>true</IgnoreExitCode>
  </Preinstall>
  <UninstallConfirm>...</UninstallConfirm>
</Package>
<¦>
<¦>
```

 Wherein **exefile** is the executable file in the add-in package to perform the pre-install step, and must be specified. **NormalArgs** specifies arguments to be passed to exefile in command-line when interactive mode is used. In this mode, the exefile can popup some dialogs for user interaction. **SilentArgs** specifies arguments to be passed to exefile in command-line when silent mode is used (-q is specified when invoking installaddin.exe). The exefile should not popup any windows in this mode. If **IgnoreExitCode** is specified with true, the pre-install step is always considered successful, otherwise, exit code 0 indicates success, 1 indicates cancellation, and other values indicate failure. Tags **NormalArgs**, **SilentArgs**, and **IgnoreExitCode** are all optional.

 A customized uninstall step can be used for any of the following:

- Replace the built-in confirmation dialog.

- Populate customized dialogs before uninstallation.

- Perform certain tasks before uninstallation.

  To implement an uninstall step, add the following contents in addin.xml (directly under Package):

```
<Package xmlns="https://schemas.microsoft.com/WindowsServerSolutions/2010/03/Addins" xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <Id>...</Id>
  <Version>...</Version>
  <Name>...</Name>
  <Allow32BitOn64BitClients>...</Allow32BitOn64BitClients>
  <ServerBinary>...</ServerBinary>
  <ClientBinary32>...</ClientBinary32>
  <ClientBinary64>...</ClientBinary64>
  <SupportedSkus>...</SupportUrl>
  <SupportUrl>...</SupportUrl>
  <Location>...</Location>
  <PrivacyStatement>...</PrivacyStatement>
  <OtherBinaries>...</OtherBinaries>
  <Preinstall>¦</Preinstall>
<UninstallConfirm>
<Executable>full-path-to-exefile</Executable>
<Arguments>command-line-arguments</Arguments>
</UninstallConfirm>
</Package>
```

 Wherein **full-path-to-exefile** specifies the exefile already installed on the system. **Arguments** is optional, and specifies the command line arguments for the exefile. The exefile is invoked before the built-in uninstall confirmation dialog pops up.

 The exefile can perform following tasks in this phase:

- Pops up some dialogs for user interaction.

- Perform some background tasks.

  The exit code of this exe file determines how the uninstall process moves forward:

- 0: the uninstall process continues without populating the built-in confirmation dialog, just as user has already confirmed. (this approach can be used to replace the built-in confirmation dialog);

- 1: the uninstall process is canceled, and finally a canceled message will be shown to user. Everything stays unchanged;

- Other: the uninstall process continues with built-in confirmation dialog, just like the customized uninstall step is not present.

  Any failure invoking the exefile will lead to the same behavior as the exefile returns a code other than 0 or 1.
