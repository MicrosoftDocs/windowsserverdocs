 If you are a Microsoft Online Service Partner Agreement (MOSPA) partner for Microsoft 365, to ensure that you are correctly compensated when a subscription request is originated from  Windows Server Essentials via the Microsoft 365 Integration Module, you need to create a registry key that contains your partner-of-record identification (POR ID). The following information is read and passed to the service provider through the Microsoft 365 sign-up URLs.

-   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Server\MSO

-   Type = String Value

-   Key name = Partner

-   Value = xxxxx, where xxxxx is your POR ID

#### To add the POR ID key to the registry

1.  On the reference computer, click **Start**, type **regedit**, and then press ENTER.

2.  In the left pane, expand **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE**, expand **SOFTWARE**, expand **Microsoft**, and then expand **Windows Server**.

3.  Right-click **Windows Server**, point to **New**, and then click **Key**.

4.  Type **MSO** for the name of the key.

5.  Right-click the key that you just created, and then click **String Value**.

6.  Type **Partner** for the name of the string, and then press ENTER.

7.  Right-click the new **Partner** string in the right pane, and then click **Modify**.

8.  Type your POR ID in the **Value data** text box, and then click **OK**.
