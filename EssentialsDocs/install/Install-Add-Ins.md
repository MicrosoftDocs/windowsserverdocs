# Install Add-Ins

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

You can include add-ins on all server or client computers by installing them before creating an image. These add-ins will then be automatically included on all computers replicated using that image. You can either install an add-in by running the .wssx file or you can install individual add-in files by following the guidance in the [SDK documentation](/previous-versions/windows/server-essentials/gg513988(v=msdn.10))for each type of add-in. If you install by using a .wssx file, the add-in can be uninstalled through the Add-In Manager. If you install the individual files, the add-in is not managed from the Add-In Manager.

> [!NOTE]
>  Any software that is installed or downloaded on the server (including Dashboard tabs and health notifications) should have a localized interface that matches the language of the operating system that is installed on the server.

#### To install an add-in

1.  (Optional) If you are installing the add-in by using a .wssx file, complete the following steps:

    1.  Save the <AddinName\>.wssx file on the reference computer.

    2.  Double click the .wssx file to open the Add-in Installation Wizard.

    3.  Follow the instructions in the wizard to complete the installation.

2.  (Optional) Install the individual add-in files in the appropriate locations as defined in the SDK for each type of add-in.
