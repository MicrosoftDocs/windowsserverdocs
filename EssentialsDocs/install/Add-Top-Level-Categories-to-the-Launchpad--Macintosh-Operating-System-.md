# Add Top-Level Categories to the Launchpad (Macintosh Operating System)

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

You can add top-level categories to the Launchpad on a computer running the Macintosh operating system. To create a Launchpad add-in that adds top-level categories, you can use a combination of information from this page and from the topic titled How-to: Add Tasks and Categories to the Launchpad? in the [Windows Server Solutions SDK](/previous-versions/windows/server-essentials/gg513988(v=msdn.10)).

 The following example shows how you can specify your Launchpad entry to be a top-level category in the .launchpad file:

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<LaunchPad resFile="Localizable">
   <Category id="Microsoft.Launchpad.HomeCategory" name="SampleAddin"  image="SampleImage01.png">
      <Task id="Microsoft.Launchpad.SampleAddin.Pictures"
          name="Pictures"
           src="smb://%ServerAddress%/Pictures"
         image="SampleImage02.png"/>
   </Category>
</LaunchPad>
```

 For the entry to be a top-level category, the Id attribute of the Category element must be "Microsoft.Launchpad.HomeCategory".
