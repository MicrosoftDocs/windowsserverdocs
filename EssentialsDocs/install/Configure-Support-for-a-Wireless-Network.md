# Configure Support for a Wireless Network

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

You can configure the operating system to support a wireless network. The following requirements must be met to enable wireless support on the server:

-   The server must have a wired network adapter installed.

-   The correct driver for the wireless network adapter must be preinstalled if the network adapter is not supported by the operating system.

-   The ability to enable and disable the wireless network adapter must be made available. Methods for doing this might include a physical button on the server or a custom user interface in the Dashboard. The product manual should provide the steps for enabling and disabling the wireless network adapter.

-   The ability to select a wireless network and connect to it must be made available. This should be done by adding a custom user interface to the Dashboard. The product manual should provide the steps for selecting and connecting to a wireless network.

-   If the ability to support a wireless ad-hoc network is needed, an extended user interface in the Dashboard must be provided. The user interface can be a button or a link that launches the Set up a Wireless Ad-hoc Network Wizard in the control panel in Windows Server 2008 R2.

## Additional considerations
 The following information should also be considered when configuring support for a wireless network:

-   The server must be connected to the network with a wire to run setup.

-   A network computer on which a bare-metal restore is performed must be connected to the network with a wire.

-   The server must be connected to the network with a wire to perform a bare-metal restore of the server.

-   If an ad-hoc network is created on the server, the wireless network adapter is dedicated for the ad-hoc network so the user must always plug the network cable into the server to obtain an Internet connection.
