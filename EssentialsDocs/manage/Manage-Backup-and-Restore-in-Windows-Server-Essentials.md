# Manage Backup and Restore in Windows Server Essentials

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

 Windows Server Essentials provides reliable ways to perform regular backups of your server and backups of your network computers. In the event of data loss, you can restore data from a successful backup on the server without restoring the entire computer. If necessary, you can perform a full system restore to your server or client computers in the network. The following table describes the different backup options available to you along with their advantages.
