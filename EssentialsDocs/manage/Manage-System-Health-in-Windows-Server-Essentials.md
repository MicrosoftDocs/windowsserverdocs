# Manage System Health in Windows Server Essentials

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

 This topic discusses how to view and respond to all alerts in your network by using the Dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
>  In  Windows Server Essentials and  Windows Server 2012 R2 with the  Windows Server Essentials Experience role installed, the health alerts for the server and client computers in the network are no longer displayed in the Alert Viewer, but instead can be viewed on the **Health Reports** tab of the **Home** page.

 Windows Server Essentials actively monitors every computer that is connected to the server and alerts the administrator to issues related to the system's health, including critical updates, missing malware protection, out-of-date virus definitions on client computers, and other important issues that require action. These issues are displayed as alerts in the Alert Viewer, which can be launched from the server's Dashboard or the client computer's Launchpad in  Windows Server Essentials, or on the **Health Reports** tab in  Windows Server Essentials. By default, the alerts are refreshed every thirty minutes, but you can evaluate your network for alerts at any time by clicking **Refresh** in the Alert Viewer or on the **Health Reports** tab.

 The following topics will help you understand, view, and respond to alerts in the Alert Viewer, and also provide instructions to configure your server to receive alert notifications in email:

-   [View alerts by using the Alert Viewer](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_View)

-   [Organize alerts in the Alert Viewer](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Organize)

-   [Respond to alerts](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Respond)

-   [Set up email notifications for alerts](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Email)

-   [Potential computer alerts](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Potential)

##  <a name="BKMK_AddIn"></a> About the Health Report Add-In
 The Health Report add-in for Windows Server Essentials provides you with consolidated information about the Windows Server Essentials network and enables you to distribute this information to other people. This information can be viewed on the **Reports** tab of the Dashboard. With the **Reports** tab, you can do the following:

-   [Generate a report on demand or on schedule](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Generate)

-   [Customize the content of the report](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Customize)

-   [Email the report](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_emailreport)

> [!NOTE]
>  **Windows Server Essentials:** You can download the Health Report add-in for  Windows Server Essentials from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=266342).
>
>  **Windows Server Essentials:** By default, the Health Report add-in is integrated with  Windows Server Essentials or  Windows Server 2012 R2 with the  Windows Server Essentials Experience role installed, and the health reports are displayed on the **Health Reports** tab of the Dashboard's **Home** page.

###  <a name="BKMK_Generate"></a> Generate a report on demand or on schedule
 After installing the Health Report add-in and restarting the Dashboard, a new tab, **Reports** is added to the Dashboard. You can generate a health report on demand at any time by clicking the **Generate a health report** task on the **Reports** tab.

 After a health report is generated, a new item is created in the list pane, identified by the date and time the report was generated. To open an item, you can double-click it in the list pane, or you can select it and then click **Open the health report** in the task pane. The report is displayed in a new window in HTML format.

 In addition to generating a report manually, you may also want the report to be generated automatically on a daily or hourly schedule. To do this, in the task pane, click **Customize health report settings**, and then click the **Schedule and Email** tab. The **Schedule** feature is off by default, and you can turn it on by selecting the **Generate a health report at its scheduled time** check box.

###  <a name="BKMK_Customize"></a> Customize the content of the report
 The health report contains the following:

- **Critical alerts and warnings** This is consistent with the critical alerts and warnings that you see in the Alert Viewer on the Dashboard. Information alerts are not included in the health report.

- **Critical errors in the event logs** Applications and service logs are scanned, and the errors that are logged in the last 24 hours will be presented in the **Details** section of the report.

- **Server backup** The information about the last server backup is presented in the **Details** section of the report.

- **Auto-start services not running** At the time the report is generated, if an auto-start service is not running, the information about this service will be listed in the **Details** section of the report.

- **Updates** You can see the update status of the server and all the client computers in the **Details** section.

- **Storage** The list of drives and their capacity is presented in the **Details** section.

  In the Health Report, first view the **Summary**, and then for those items with a red error icon or a yellow warning icon, click the **Details** link on the same row to view the details about the item.

  If you are not interested in some of the data points that are included in the report by default, you can customize the content of the report by clicking **Customize health report settings** in the task pane, and then clicking the **Content** tab. Clear the check boxes for the content that you don't want to see in the report. For example, if you have your own server backup plan and don't want to see the warnings about server backups, you could exclude server backups from the report by clearing the **Server backup** check box.

###  <a name="BKMK_emailreport"></a> Email the report
 Having to log on to the Dashboard to read reports is still inconvenient for some administrators, especially if they have more than one server to manage. With the email feature turned on, after a report is generated, an email will be sent to a list of specified email addresses with the content of the report. The administrator can easily view this report from any device or any client application, and ensure that the server is running at its best state.

 In the **Customize Health Report Settings** dialog box, after you enable email, change the SMTP settings, and specify a list of email recipients, you will notice that a new task shows up in the task pane: **Email the health report**. For more information about SMTP Settings, see [Set up email notifications for alerts](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Email).

 You can select an existing report, and then click **Email the health report**. You can also generate a new report, and have it automatically sent to your Inbox. If you have configured a schedule for the report to be automatically generated, the report will be automatically delivered to your Inbox after being generated every day (or every hour) as scheduled.

##  <a name="BKMK_View"></a> View alerts by using the Alert Viewer

    2.  Select **Filter by alert type**, and click the alert type (Critical, Warning, or Informational) for which you would like to view the alerts. This displays only the selected alert type in the Alert Viewer.

##  <a name="BKMK_Respond"></a> Respond to alerts
 When you encounter an alert, you can opt to do one of the following:

-   [Resolve an alert](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Resolve)

-   [Ignore an alert](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_3)

-   [Enable an alert](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_5)

-   [Delete an alert](Manage-System-Health-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_4)

###  <a name="BKMK_Resolve"></a> Resolve an alert
 Follow the resolution instructions in the Alert Viewer to resolve the alert. After an alert is resolved, it is still displayed in the Alert Viewer until it is refreshed.

###  <a name="BKMK_3"></a> Ignore an alert
 You can choose to ignore an alert if you prefer to respond to it later. When you ignore an alert, it is still listed in the Alert Viewer, and but it is disabled and dimmed. An ignored alert is not included in the overall health assessment of the computer. To address an ignored alert, you first need to enable the alert.

##### To ignore an alert

1. From the computer that is connected to the Windows Server Essentials server, open the Launchpad.

2. On the Launchpad, click the any of the displayed alert icons (critical, warning, and informational). This opens the Alert Viewer.

3. In the Alert Viewer, select the alert that you want to ignore, and then in the **Tasks** section, click **Ignore the alert**.

   To respond to a disabled alert, you will need to first enable the alert.

###  <a name="BKMK_5"></a> Enable an alert
 You can enable an alert that you chose to ignore earlier. After the alert is enabled, you can resolve it or delete it as needed. An alert appears as disabled when marked to be ignored. When you enable an alert that you have previously disabled, it becomes active and is again included in the overall health assessment of computers.

##### To enable an alert

1.  From the computer that is connected to the server, open the Launchpad.

2.  On the Launchpad, click any of the displayed alert icons (critical, warning, and informational) to open the Alert Viewer.

3.  In the Alert Viewer, right-click the alert that you want to enable, and then click **Enable the alert**.

###  <a name="BKMK_4"></a> Delete an alert
 You can delete an alert if you do not want to resolve or ignore it. You can use the Alert Viewer on the Launchpad to delete alerts generated for your computer. If you delete an alert and the server detects the problem again in the next network health evaluation cycle, it generates a new alert.

##### To delete an alert

1.  From the computer that is connected to the server, open the Launchpad.

2.  On the Launchpad, click any of the displayed alert icons (critical, warning, and informational) to open the Alert Viewer.

3.  In the Alert Viewer, right-click the alert that you want to delete, and then click **Delete the alert**.

##  <a name="BKMK_Email"></a> Set up email notifications for alerts
 You can configure your server to notify you through email about the occurrence of alerts. The email notifications for these alerts contain information about the network issues and its resolution steps, which is identical to the information that is displayed in the Alert Viewer. Some of the network health evaluations are made programmatically.

 When you configure your server to send alert notifications in email, an email notification is sent for alerts that are found during the network health evaluation. However, not all alerts that are reported in the Alert Viewer are reported in email.

 Every thirty minutes, the Alert Email Evaluation task runs on the server, which evaluates the network for alerts. An email notification is sent out if any alert that is set for email notification occurs. A second email is not sent if the alert is still active in the next evaluation cycle to avoid flooding your mailbox. However, if a new alert is detected within a future alert evaluation cycle, an email notification is sent, which includes the new and previous alerts.
