# Configure DirectAccess in Windows Server Essentials

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

This topic provides step-by-step instructions for configuring DirectAccess in  Windows Server Essentials to enable your mobile workforce to seamlessly connect to your organization's network from any Internet-equipped remote location without establishing a virtual private network (VPN) connection. DirectAccess can offer mobile workers the same connectivity experience inside and outside the office from their  Windows 8.1,  Windows 8, and  Windows 7 computers.

 In  Windows Server Essentials, if the domain contains more than one  Windows Server Essentials server, DirectAccess must be configured on the domain controller.

> [!NOTE]
>  This topic provides instructions for configuring DirectAccess when your  Windows Server Essentials server is the domain controller. If the  Windows Server Essentials server is a domain member, follow the instructions to configure DirectAccess on a domain member in [Add DirectAccess to an Existing Remote Access (VPN) Deployment](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/jj574220(v=ws.11)) instead.
