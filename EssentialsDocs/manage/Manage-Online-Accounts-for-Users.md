# Manage Online Accounts for Windows Server Essentials Users

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

When you integrate your  Windows Server Essentials server with Microsoft 365, you can manage your online accounts along with user accounts from the Dashboard. In this topic, you'll find out what you can gain by managing your users  Microsoft Online Services accounts from the Dashboard, how to create and manage online accounts from the Dashboard, and how to manage email addresses and distribution groups for Exchange Online from the Dashboard.


> [!NOTE]
>  To manage your Microsoft Online Services accounts in  Windows Server Essentials, you must integrate your server with  Microsoft 365. For instructions, see [Manage Microsoft 365](Manage-Office-365-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If you  managing online accounts in  Windows Server Essentials, you  accustomed to seeing the Microsoft Online Services accounts referred to as *Microsoft 365 accounts*. On the Dashboard in  Windows Server Essentials, the labels were changed to *Microsoft Online Services accounts*, or *Microsoft online accounts* for short. The accounts and the procedures are the same; only the labels changed. Most procedures in this topic use the term *online account*.

-   [Why should I manage my online accounts from the Dashboard?](#BKMK_WhyManageOnlineAccounts)

-   [Create online accounts](#BKMK_SECTION_CreateOnlineAccounts)

-   [Manage online accounts](#BKMK_SECTION_ManageOnlineAccounts)

-   [Manage email addresses for Exchange Online](#BKMK_SECTION_ManageEmailAddresses)

##  <a name="BKMK_WhyManageOnlineAccounts"></a> Why should I manage my online accounts from the Dashboard?
 When you use the Dashboard to assign a Microsoft Online Services account to a user account, the account passwords are automatically synchronized, and you can maintain the two accounts together throughout the user account s lifecycle.

 It s convenient for the user, who can use the same password to access resources on the server and in  Microsoft 365. And you can apply the same password requirements for access to resources in  Microsoft 365 that you require for your in-house resources.

### How does password synchronization work?
 When you use the Dashboard to assign a Microsoft Online Services account to a user account, the user account password is automatically synchronized with the user s online account. This means that a user only needs a single password to access both the resources on the server and in  Microsoft 365. Furthermore, you can use the same name for the user account and the user s online ID.

 Password synchronization occurs immediately and automatically when a user changes the password for their user account from a domain-joined computer or by using Remote Web Access.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If  Microsoft 365 is integrated with  Windows Server Essentials, users should not change the password for their Microsoft online account from the  Microsoft 365 portal. Doing so will break the password synchronization.

### Simplified account creation
 There s another advantage when you create your initial online accounts from the Dashboard. You can create online accounts for all of your users with a single action. On the other hand, if your employees are using  Microsoft 365 already, and you  setting up a new  Windows Server Essentials server, you can create all of your user accounts from the online accounts with a single action. For more information, see [Create online accounts](#BKMK_SECTION_CreateOnlineAccounts).

### Manage email addresses and distribution groups from the Dashboard
 You will be able to manage your email addresses and distribution groups for Exchange Online from the Dashboard. And you can use your organization s Internet domain in the email addresses. You can do all of this from the Dashboard, without signing in to  Microsoft 365. (You ll need to be using  Windows Server Essentials to manage distribution groups from the Dashboard. This feature is not supported in  Windows Server Essentials.) For more information, see [Manage email addresses for Exchange Online](#BKMK_SECTION_ManageEmailAddresses) and [Manage distribution groups for Exchange Online](#BKMK_SECTION_ManageDistributionGroups).

### Manage the user account and online account together
 And you can manage an online account along with the user account throughout the account s lifecycle. If you deactivate the user account, the online account also is deactivated in Microsoft Online Services. If you remove a user account, the online account also is removed. For more information, see [Manage online accounts](#BKMK_SECTION_ManageOnlineAccounts).

##  <a name="BKMK_SECTION_CreateOnlineAccounts"></a> Create online accounts
 After you integrate your server with  Microsoft 365, it s to your advantage to create Microsoft Online Services accounts for your users from the Dashboard. You ll have a lot of flexibility in creating the online accounts. If you have a new  Microsoft 365 subscription, you can bulk-create online accounts for all of your users. If you have already created your online accounts in  Microsoft 365, don t worry. If you  setting up a new server, you can create your user accounts on the server by importing the online accounts. And you can assign either a new or an existing online account when you create an individual user account or when you add an online account to an existing user account.

 **License requirements** You will need a user license for each online account that you create. Check the **Microsoft 365** page on the Dashboard to see how many user licenses are available through your  Microsoft 365 subscription. If you need to add more user licenses, you ll be able to open your  Microsoft 365 subscription in  Microsoft 365 to do that.

 **Follow-up for users** After you add an online account for a user account, the user is required to change the password for their user account the next time they sign in. The new password is synchronized immediately with their online account. After that, they can use the password to sign in to  Microsoft 365 with their online ID.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Emphasize to your users that they should never change their online account password in  Microsoft 365. The password will be changed automatically whenever they change the password for their user account. If they change the online password in  Microsoft 365, password synchronization will be broken.

 Use the procedures in this section to:

-   [Bulk-create online accounts for your existing user accounts](#BKMK_ToBulkCreateOnlineAccounts)

-   [Import user accounts from your Microsoft Online Services accounts](#BKMK_ToImportUserAccounts)

-   [Create a new user account with an online account assigned to it](#BKMK_ToCreateaNewUserAccount)

-   [Assign an online account to a user account](#BKMK_ToAssignAnOnlineAccount)

> [!NOTE]
>  If you  using  Windows Server Essentials, you will see *Microsoft 365 account* instead of *Microsoft Online Services account* throughout these procedures. The process is the same, but the terminology changed in  Windows Server Essentials.

###  <a name="BKMK_ToBulkCreateOnlineAccounts"></a> To bulk-create online accounts for your existing user accounts

1.  Sign in on the server as an administrator, and open the  Windows Server Essentials Dashboard.

2.  On the Dashboard, open the **Users** page.

3.  In **Users Tasks**, click **Add Microsoft online accounts**.

     The **Add Microsoft Online Services accounts** page of the wizard displays all user accounts that do not have a Microsoft online account. All of the accounts are selected by default, and the user name is suggested for the Microsoft online ID. If you have linked a custom Internet domain to your  Microsoft 365 subscription, that domain will be used by default.

4.  On the **Add Microsoft Online Services accounts** page, review the accounts that will be created. For example, check for users who already have an online account with a different online ID, and make sure the domain that you want to use in email addresses is selected. When you finish making any needed changes, click **Next**.

5.  On the **Assign Microsoft Online Services licenses** page, select  Microsoft 365 services your users will use. When you click **Next**, account creation will begin.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  You must have a service license in  Microsoft 365 for each online account. You can check your available licenses and, if needed, open your subscription to add licenses from the **Microsoft 365** page on the Dashboard.

6.  Notify users that they now have a Microsoft online account. They must change their network user account password before they can sign in to  Microsoft 365. For instructions, see [To begin using a new Microsoft online account](#BKMK_ToBeginUsingAnOnlineAccount).

###  <a name="BKMK_ToBeginUsingAnOnlineAccount"></a> To begin using a new Microsoft online account

1.  Sign in on your computer with your network user account.

2.  Change the password for your user account. To get started, press Ctrl+Alt+Delete, and click **Change a password**.

3.  To create the user accounts:

    1.  Make any changes that are needed to the proposed user accounts.

    2.  Optionally click the link to view the temporary passwords that will be assigned to the user accounts. You will need to give your users their temporary password along with their new account name.

         (After you create the accounts, you ll find these passwords listed in this file: *SystemDrive*\Users\\*Office365admin*\\*NewServerUser*.txt where *Office365admin* is the network account that is used to administer  Microsoft 365 on the server and *NewServerUser* is the new user account name.)

    3.  Click **Next** to create the user accounts.

4.  Let your users know their new user accounts and the temporary passwords they will use to sign in on the server for the first time  œ and that they will have to change the password after they sign in. For instructions for your users, see [To begin using a new Microsoft online account](#BKMK_ToBeginUsingAnOnlineAccount).

##  <a name="BKMK_SECTION_ManageOnlineAccounts"></a> Manage online accounts
 When you add an online account to a user account in Windows Server Essentials, you can manage both accounts together throughout the account s lifecycle.

###  <a name="BKMK_UnderstandingAccountStatus"></a> Understanding the online account status
 When you assign a Microsoft Online Services account to a user account, the email address for the account appears in the **Microsoft online account** column on the **Users** page of the Dashboard. (In  Windows Server Essentials, the column label is **Microsoft 365 account**.)

-   A blue icon next to an email address indicates the online account is active. That is, the account has a current  Microsoft 365 license, and the user can use the online ID to sign in to  Microsoft 365.

-   A shaded icon next to the email address indicates the online account is inactive  œ either because the license is no longer active or the online account has been unassigned. When you unassign a user s online account, the license is removed, and the user is blocked from signing in to  Microsoft 365 using the account. However, the server maintains the mapping between the user account name and the  Microsoft 365 email address.

###  <a name="BKMK_UnassignOnlineAccount"></a> Restrict access to an online account
 What do you do if a user leaves your organization, or you want to restrict the user s access to your  Microsoft 365 services? If you  managing your users  online accounts along with their user accounts in  Windows Server Essentials, you have three options:

-   **Unassign the online account** ?If you want to keep a user from using  Microsoft 365 without preventing access to resources on the server, you should unassign the online account. The  Microsoft 365 license will be released, and the user is blocked from signing in to  Microsoft 365. However, the server maintains the mapping between the user account name and the  Microsoft 365 email address. For instructions, see [To unassign an online account from a user account](#BKMK_ToUnassignAnOnlineAccount).

-   **Deactivate the user account** ?If you deactivate a user account because an employee leaves, either temporarily or permanently, the user s online account also is deactivated. The online account cannot be used, but the user data, including email, is retained in Microsoft Online Services. For instructions, see [Deactivate a user account](Manage-User-Accounts-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Manage6) in [Manage User Accounts](Manage-User-Accounts-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).

-   **Remove the user account** ?If you remove a user account, the online account is removed from Microsoft Online Services also. For instructions, see [Remove a user account](Manage-User-Accounts-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_Remove) in [Manage User Accounts](Manage-User-Accounts-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).

    > [!WARNING]
