##  <a name="BKMK_1"></a> Manage devices by using the Dashboard
 Windows Server Essentials makes it possible to perform common administrative tasks by using the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard. The **Devices** page of the Dashboard provides the following:

-   A list of network computers, which displays:

    -   The name of the computer

    -   The status of the computer, either **Online** or **Offline**

    -   The computer description

    -   The backup status of the computer

    -   The update status of the computer

    -   The security status of the computer

    -   The alerts status of the computer

    -   Group Policy information for the computer

-   A details pane with additional information about a selected computer

-   A tasks pane that includes a set of device administrative tasks such as viewing computer properties and alerts, setting up computer backup, and restoring files and folders from a backup

#### To view the status of network computers

1. Open the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard.

2. On the navigation bar, click **Devices**.

3. View the status of all the computers in the network in the list pane.

   The following table describes the various computer and backup tasks that are available in the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard. Some of the tasks are computer-specific, and they are only visible when you select a computer in the list.

##  <a name="BKMK_2"></a> Assign user accounts permission to log on to specific network computers
 You can assign permissions to user accounts so that users can log on to only specific network computers when accessing the Windows Server Essentials network from a remote location.

#### To change the computer access for a user account

1.  Open the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard.

2.  On the navigation bar, click **Users**.

3.  In the list of user accounts, select the user account that you want to change.

4.  In the **<User Account\> Tasks** pane, click **View the account properties**. The **Properties** page for the user account appears.

5.  On the **Computer access** tab, select the computer that this user can access remotely, and then click **OK**.

##  <a name="BKMK_3"></a> Remove a computer from the server
 When you remove a computer from a server that is running Windows Server Essentials by using the Dashboard, it is no longer managed by the server. As a result, the server will stop creating computer backups or monitor its health after its removal from the network.

> [!NOTE]
>  Removal of a computer from the server does not disconnect the computer from the network. The computer can still access resources on the network in the same way it could before being connected to the server. To prevent the computer from accessing server resources and to disconnect it from the server, you must remove the computer from the domain. In addition, removal of the computer from the server does not automatically uninstall the Connector software or the Launchpad from the computer that is being removed. You must manually remove the Connector software from the computer. For more information, see the section Uninstall the Connector software in [Get Connected](../use/Get-Connected-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md).

#### To remove a computer from the network by using the Dashboard

1.  Open the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard.

2.  On the navigation bar, click the **Devices** tab.

3.  In the list of computers, right-click the computer that you want to remove from the network, and then click **Remove the computer**.

##  <a name="BKMK_5"></a> Configure Group Policy settings for folder redirection and security
 You can configure Group Policy and deploy it to computers in the Windows Server Essentials network by using the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard. Group Policy in Windows Server Essentials includes settings for folder redirection and security that impact Windows Update, Windows Defender, and the network firewall.

#### To configure Group Policy in Windows Server Essentials

1.  Open the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard.

2.  On the navigation bar, click **DEVICES**.

3.  For  Windows Server Essentials: In the global **Users Tasks** pane, click **Implement Group Policy**.

     For  Windows Server Essentials: In the global **Devices Tasks** pane, click **Implement Group Policy**.

4.  The Implement Group Policy Wizard opens.

5.  On the **Enable Folder Redirection Group Policy** page of the wizard, you can choose the user folders that you want to redirect.

6.  On the **Enable Security Policy Settings** page of the wizard, you can choose to enable Group Policy settings for **Windows Update**, **Windows Defender**, and the **Network Firewall**.

7.  Click **Finish** to implement the Group Policy settings.

##  <a name="BKMK_7"></a> Connect to a network computer by using a Remote Desktop session
 To remotely access your Windows Server Essentials network computer when you are away from your office, use your Web browser to log on to your organization's Remote Web Access website, and on the **Computers** tab, click the name of the computer.

 The **Status** column shows you if you can connect to a computer on your network, and can contain the following values:

-   **Available**

     The computer is turned on and is available for a remote connection. Even if you see this status, you still may not be able to connect to this computer if a third-party firewall blocks the connection.

-   **Offline or Sleeping**

     The computer is turned off or is in Sleep or Hibernate mode. If a computer is offline or sleeping, the status is updated in real time so that you can know when the computer becomes available.

-   **Unsupported operating system**

     The operating system on the computer does not support remote desktop. It may take up to 6 hours for this status to be updated on the server if there is a change.

-   **Connection is disabled**

     The computer connection is either blocked by a firewall, or the remote desktop is disabled on the computer or by Group Policy. It may take up to 6 hours for this status to be updated on the server if there is a change.
