# Manage Applications in Windows Server Essentials

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

 The server Dashboard in Windows Server Essentials and  Windows Server 2012 R2 with the  Windows Server Essentials Experience role installed makes it possible to perform common administrative tasks. To perform these tasks, see the following:

-   [Application management tasks in the Dashboard](Manage-Applications-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_1)

-   [Install or remove add-ins using the Dashboard](Manage-Applications-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_2)

 The **Applications** management page of the Dashboard provides:

- A list of installed add-ins, which displays:

##  <a name="BKMK_2"></a> Install or remove add-ins using the Dashboard
 An add-in is a software application that provides additional features and functionality for your server. A growing number of add-ins are available from Microsoft and other Independent Software Vendors (ISVs).

 Before you can take advantage of the extended functionality that an add-in provides, you must first install the add-in on the server.

#### To install an add-in from Microsoft Pinpoint

3.  On the add-in information page, click Download, and follow the onscreen instructions to download and install the add-in.

4.  Follow the instructions in the wizard to install the add-in.

5.  When the installation is finished, restart the Dashboard, open the **Applications** page of the server Dashboard, and verify that the add-in appears in the list view.

#### To install an add-in from another provider

1.  Open Windows Explorer and browse to the location of the add-in installation file.

2.  Double-click the file to run the installation wizard.

3.  Follow the instructions in the wizard to install the add-in.

4.  When the installation is finished, restart the Dashboard, open the **Applications** page, and then verify that the add-in appears in the list view.

#### To remove an add-in
