# Manage Online Backup in Windows Server Essentials

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

 After you integrate with  Microsoft Azure Backup, the **Online Backup** management page appears in the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard. The **Online Backup** page makes it possible to perform common administrative tasks. The features on the Online Backup page include:

- The following sub-section pages:

  -   **Online Backup** After you register the server for online backup, this section displays the current backup status, storage status, and account information.

  -   **Protected Folders** This section lists all shared folders and all File History folders on the server, and any other folders that you have chosen to back up in  Azure. The list includes the folder name, folder path, and status for each shared folder.

  -   **Backup History** This section displays a list of recent online backups. The list includes the type of operation, and the time and status for each backup.

- A details pane with additional information about a selected backup job or restore job.

- A tasks pane that includes a set of administrative tasks that you can perform.

  As a best practice, you should back up the most important business and user data. For example, you should back up server folders that contain critical data files. You should also back up the File History for network computers that contain critical information.

  When deciding which data to back up online, consider the backup frequency and retention policy that you want to implement. Then review your budget and determine the amount of storage space you can afford. Balance the cost and volume of storage against your needs, and then configure online backup to protect as much of your important data as possible. For pricing information, see [pricing details for Azure Backup](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/backup/).

  The following sections describe various online backup tasks that can appear in the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard.

## Online backup tasks in the Dashboard

-   [Upload a certificate to the Azure Backup vault](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_1)

-   [Configure online backup](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_2)

-   [Start an online backup](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_3)

-   [Restore files and folders from an online backup](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_4)

-   [Unregister server](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_6)

###  <a name="BKMK_1"></a> Upload a certificate to the Azure Backup vault
 Before you can use  Azure Backup for online backups in Windows Server Essentials, you must upload a public certificate to register with the backup vault. The certificate is used to authenticate the  Azure Backup deployment (the agent), acting on behalf of the Microsoft Online Services subscription owner to manage resources associated with the subscription.

> [!NOTE]
>  Before you upload the certificate, you must complete the procedures in [Sign up for Azure Backup Service](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_16).

##### To upload a certificate to use with the Azure Backup Service

1. Log on to the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard with an administrator account.

2. On the Dashboard **Home** page, click **ONLINE BACKUP**.

3. In the **ONLINE BACKUP** area, click **Upload certificate to Azure Backup vault**.

    That opens **Recovery Services** in the  Azure Management Portal. If you aren't already signed in to  Azure, you'll need to sign in using your Microsoft account.

4. Click the name of the backup vault you'll use for online backups to open the **Quick Start** page for the backup vault.

5. Click **Manage Certificate**.

6. In the **Manage Certificate** dialog box, paste the path of the public certificate generated by Windows Server Essentials. To obtain the path of the public certificate, do the following:

   1.  On the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard, click the **Online Backup** tab.

   2.  On the **Online Backup** page, copy the path of the generated certificate.

   3.  Switch to the  Azure Management Portal, and then in the **Manage Certificate** dialog box, paste the path to upload the generated public certificate.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  You can also use your own public certificate. To know what certificate is required, on the **Quick Start** page, click the **Acquire Certificate** link.

   > [!NOTE]
   >   Azure requires an x.509 v2 certificate with a public key. For more information, see [Manage vault certificates](/previous-versions/azure/dn169036(v=azure.100)).

7. After you select the certificate, click **OK** (check mark).

8. You are returned to the **Quick Start** page. Click **Dashboard**, and verify that the certificate was uploaded successfully. After the certificate is uploaded successfully, the dashboard displays the certificate thumbprint and expiration date.

   After completing this procedure, do the following:

9. Register the server with the  Azure Backup Service. For more information, see [Register this server for backup](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_5).

10. Configure online backup of the server. For more information, see [Configure online backup](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_2).

###  <a name="BKMK_2"></a> Configure online backup
 After you register the server with  Azure Backup, you can configure the online backup settings in Windows Server Essentials.

##### To configure online backup

1.  Either from the Register Your Server Wizard or from the **Online Backup** page of the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard, click **Configure online backup**. The Configure Online Backup Wizard appears.

2.  On the **Configure Online Backup** page of the wizard, select the check box for each server folder that you want to back up to  Azure Backup. Clear the check box for each server folder that you do not want to include in the backup. To add folders that are not shown in the list, click **Add Folders**. When you finish your selection, click **Next**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >  You cannot select a folder that is not located on the local server, or a folder that is on a drive that is formatted as ReFS.

3.  On the **Add File History Backups** page of the wizard, you can select to include File History Backups for network computers that support the File History feature. Then click **Next** to continue.

4.  On the **Specify the Backup Schedule** page of the wizard, configure the following and then click **Next** to continue:

    -   Select or accept the time of day when you want the online backup to run. The default time is 10:00 PM. You may also specify a time to run a second backup.

    -   Select or accept the days when you want the online backup to run. By default, online backup runs on Monday through Friday.

5.  On the **Specify the Backup Retention Policy** page of the wizard, select the number of days that you want to keep online backups, and then click **Next**. The default is 7 days. You can also choose to keep online backups for 15 or 30 days.

    > [!NOTE]
    >   Azure Backup always retains your most recent backup. If the backup destination does not have sufficient space available to store the backup, the backup process will not succeed. To avoid this situation, either purchase additional storage space, or shorten the data retention period. For pricing information, see [Pricing Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/backup/) for  Microsoft Azure Backup.

6.  On the **Choose your bandwidth usage** page of the wizard, if you want to restrict the amount of Internet bandwidth that is allocated to online backup, select **Enable Internet bandwidth usage**. Use the options on the page to specify how much Internet bandwidth to allow your online backup to use during work hours and during non-work hours. Then define your business hours and business days.

    > [!NOTE]
    >   Azure Backup allows you to customize how the integration software utilizes the network bandwidth when backing up or restoring information. Using a technique commonly known as throttling, you can control the amount of network bandwidth that is available for use by the backup and restore processes during specific day and time intervals. After selecting the **Enable Internet bandwidth usage** check box in the Configure Online Backup wizard, you can specify the workdays and work hours during which to apply the work-hours bandwidth limit. The non-work-hours limit is used at all other times. Valid bandwidth ranges are from 256 Kbps to Unlimited for both limits.

7.  When the online backup configuration completes, click **Close**.

    > [!TIP]
    >  After a successful backup configuration, the **Online Backup** page shows the status of the most recent online backup and the amount of storage space used by the backup vault. To see the status of previous backups, click **Backup History**.

###  <a name="BKMK_3"></a> Start an online backup

> [!NOTE]
>  Before you can start an online backup, you must first [Register this server for backup](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_5), and then [Configure online backup](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_2).

###  <a name="BKMK_17"></a> Integrate Azure Backup with Windows Server Essentials
 The  Microsoft Azure Backup integration module is a new feature of Windows Server Essentials that enables you to encrypt and back up files and folders from your server to an  Azure-hosted storage system provided by Microsoft. By using  Azure Backup to encrypt and back up data on the server, you can help prevent catastrophic loss of critical business data due to fire, flood, theft, or other disasters. When you use  Azure Backup to back up server data, the information is encrypted using your passphrase before it is uploaded to a secure datacenter on the Internet. To access data from an online backup, you must have a server that is authenticated by a certificate and must provide the passphrase.

 After integrating and registering the server with  Azure Backup, you can configure online backup settings to perform regularly scheduled backups. You can also initiate an online backup at any time by clicking the **Start backup now** task in the Online Backup Dashboard.

 The online backup setup involves these steps:

1.  [Sign up for Azure Backup Service](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_16) - After you sign up for the Backup service, you will create a backup vault, download and install the  Azure Backup integration module.

2.  [Upload a certificate to the Azure Backup vault](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_1)

3.  [Register this server for backup](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_5)

4.  [Configure online backup](Manage-Online-Backup-in-Windows-Server-Essentials.md#BKMK_2)

> [!NOTE]
>   Azure Backup uses the passphrase to encrypt files and folders for the online backup. Changing the encryption passphrase will replace the passphrase that you specified when you registered the server. The passphrase accepts only ASCII-coded characters.
