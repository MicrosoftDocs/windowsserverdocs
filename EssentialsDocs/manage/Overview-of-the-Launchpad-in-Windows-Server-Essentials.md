# Overview of the Launchpad in Windows Server Essentials

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

The Windows Server Essentials Launchpad is a small application that is installed on a computer the first time the computer connects to the server.

Administrators can use the Launchpad to access the server Dashboard, even if the computer is not connected to the network.
