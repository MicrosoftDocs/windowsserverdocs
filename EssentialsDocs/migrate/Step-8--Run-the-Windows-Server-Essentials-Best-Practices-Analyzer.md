When you finish migrating your settings and data to  Windows Server Essentials, you should run the  Windows Server Essentials Best Practices Analyzer (BPA) on the Destination Server.

2.  In Server Manager, click the **Windows Server Essentials Experience** tab.

3.  In the details pane, select **Best Practices Analyzer**.

4.  Click **Tasks**, and then click **Start BPA scan**.

5.  Review each BPA message, and follow the instructions to resolve issues, if necessary.

## Next steps
