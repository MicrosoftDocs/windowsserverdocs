When you finish migrating your settings and data to  Windows Server Essentials, you should run the  Windows Server Essentials Best Practices Analyzer (BPA) on the Destination Server. The BPA examines a server that is running  Windows Server Essentials and presents a report that describes issues and provides recommendations for resolving them. The recommendations are developed by the product support organization for  Windows Server Essentials.  
  
### To run the  Windows Server Essentials BPA on the Destination Server  
  
1.  Log on to the Destination Server as an administrator, and then open Server Manager.  
  
2.  In Server Manager, click the **Windows Server Essentials Experience** tab.  
  
3.  In the details pane, select **Best Practices Analyzer**.  
  
4.  Click **Tasks**, and then click **Start BPA scan**.  
  
5.  Review each BPA message, and follow the instructions to resolve issues, if necessary.  
  
## Next steps  
 You have run the  Windows Server Essentials Best Practices Analyzer. Your migration to  Windows Server Essentials is now complete.
