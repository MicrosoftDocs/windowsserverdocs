## Terms and definitions
 **Source Server** The existing server from which you are migrating your settings and data.

 **Destination Server** The new server to which you are migrating your settings and data.

## Migration process summary
 This migration guide includes the following steps:

1. [Step 1: Prepare your Source Server for Windows Server Essentials migration](Step-1--Prepare-your-Source-Server-for-Windows-Server-Essentials-migration.md).  You must ensure that your Source Server and network are ready for migration. This section guides you through backing up the Source Server, evaluating the Source Server system health, installing the most recent service packs and fixes, and verifying the network configuration.

2. [Step 2: Install Windows Server Essentials as a new replica domain controller](Step-2--Install-Windows-Server-Essentials-as-a-new-replica-domain-controller.md). This section describes how to install  Windows Server Essentials, or  Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard (with the Windows Server Essentials Experience role enabled) as a domain controller.

3. [Step 3: Join computers to the new Windows Server Essentials server](Step-3--Join-computers-to-the-new-Windows-Server-Essentials-server.md).  This section explains how to join client computers to the new server running  Windows Server Essentials and updating Group Policy settings.

4. [Step 4: Move settings and data to the Destination Server for Windows Server Essentials migration](Step-4--Move-settings-and-data-to-the-Destination-Server-for-Windows-Server-Essentials-migration.md).  This section provides information about migrating data and settings from the Source Server.

5. [Step 5: Enable folder redirection on the Destination Server for Windows Server Essentials migration](Step-5--Enable-folder-redirection-on-the-Destination-Server-for-Windows-Server-Essentials-migration.md).  If folder redirection is enabled on the Source Server, you can enable folder redirection on the Destination Server, and then delete the old Folder Redirection Group Policy setting.

6. [Step 6: Demote and remove the Source Server from the new Windows Server Essentials network](Step-6--Demote-and-remove-the-Source-Server-from-the-new-Windows-Server-Essentials-network.md).  Prior to removing the Source Server from the network, you must force a Group Policy update and demote the Source Server.

7. [Step 7: Perform post-migration tasks for the Windows Server Essentials migration](Step-7--Perform-post-migration-tasks-for-the-Windows-Server-Essentials-migration.md).  After you finish migrating all settings and data to  Windows Server Essentials, you may want to map permitted computers to user accounts.

8. [Step 8: Run the Windows Server Essentials Best Practices Analyzer](Step-8--Run-the-Windows-Server-Essentials-Best-Practices-Analyzer.md).  After you finish migrating settings and data to  Windows Server Essentials, you should run the  Windows Server Essentials Best Practices Analyzer (BPA).

   Several of the migration procedures require that you open a Command Prompt window as an administrator. The following procedures explain how to do this.
