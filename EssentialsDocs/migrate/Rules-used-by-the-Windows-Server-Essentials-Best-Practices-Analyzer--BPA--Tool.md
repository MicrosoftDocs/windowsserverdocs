# Rules used by the Windows Server Essentials Best Practices Analyzer (BPA) Tool

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 Essentials

This article describes the rules used by the  Windows Server Essentials Best Practices Analyzer (BPA). The BPA examines a server that is running  Windows Server Essentials and presents a report that describes issues and provides recommendations for resolving them. The recommendations are developed by the product support organization for  Windows Server Essentials.

## Using the tool
 It is a standard practice, when you migrate to  Windows Server Essentials from Windows Server 2011 Essentials, Windows Small Business Server 2011 Essentials, or Windows Home Server 2011, to run the BPA on the Destination Server after you finish migrating your settings and data. You can run the tool from the Dashboard at any time.

#### To run the  Windows Server Essentials BPA on the server

1.  Log on to the server as an administrator, and then open the Dashboard.

2.  On the Dashboard, click the **Devices** tab.

3.  On the **Server Tasks** pane, click **Best Practices Analyzer**.

4.  Review each BPA message, and follow the instructions to resolve issues if necessary.
