# WindowsServerDocs-pr

This repo is actively managed and includes the source for three content sets published to the TechNet technical library:

-  [Windows Server 2016](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/get-started/windows-server-2016)
-  [Essentials Server 2016](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server-essentials/get-started/what-s-new)
-  [Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2016](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-server-2016)

Writers and engineering partners share responsibility for the technical accuracy, within specific technology areas. **The writer for an assigned area reviews and approves all pull requests to add, update, or delete articles or art.** For Windows Server content, these writers are:

To make a small update, simply edit the file and submit a pull request. For substantive changes, new articles, and deletions, consult with the area owner before spending any significant time. It's the writer's responsibility to manage their area as a content set within the larger content portfolio. This helps us avoid duplication, identify content gaps, and consider how the various articles fit together.

Info on how to add or update content, minimum quality standards, formatting help and more is available in the [Contributor's Guide](./Contributor-guide/Contributor-index.md), in this repo.
