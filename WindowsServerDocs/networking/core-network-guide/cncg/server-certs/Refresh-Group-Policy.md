# Refresh Group Policy

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

You can use this procedure to manually refresh Group Policy on the local computer. When Group Policy is refreshed, if certificate autoenrollment is configured and functioning correctly, the local computer is autoenrolled a certificate by the certification authority (CA).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Group Policy is automatically refreshed when you restart the domain member computer, or when a user logs on to a domain member computer. In addition, Group Policy is periodically refreshed. By default, this periodic refresh is performed every 90 minutes with a randomized offset of up to 30 minutes.  
  
Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, is the minimum required to complete this procedure.  
  
### To refresh Group Policy on the local computer  
  
1.  On the computer where NPS is installed, open Windows PowerShell&reg; by using the icon on the taskbar.  
  
2.  At the Windows PowerShell prompt, type **gpupdate**, and then press ENTER.
