# Install the Web Server WEB1

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

The Web Server (IIS) role in Windows Server 2016 provides a secure, easy-to-manage, modular and extensible platform for reliably hosting websites, services, and applications. With IIS, you can share information with users on the Internet, an intranet, or an extranet. IIS is a unified web platform that integrates IIS, ASP.NET, FTP services, PHP, and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).

When you deploy server certificates, your Web server provides you with a location where you can publish the certificate revocation list (CRL) for your certification authority (CA). After publication, the CRL is accessible to all computers on your network so that they can use this list during the authentication process to verify that certificates presented by other computers are not revoked.

If a certificate is on the CRL as revoked, the authentication effort fails and your computer is protected from trusting an entity that has a certificate that is no longer valid.

Before you install the Web Server (IIS) role, ensure that you have configured the server name and IP address and have joined the computer to the domain.
