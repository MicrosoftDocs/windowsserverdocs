# Delete DNS Resource Records

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

You can use this topic to delete one or more DNS resource records by using the IPAM client console.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, is the minimum required to perform this procedure.

### To delete DNS resource records

1.  In Server Manager, click  **IPAM**. The IPAM client console appears.

2.  In the navigation pane, in **MONITOR AND MANAGE**, click **DNS Zones**.  The navigation pane divides into an upper navigation pane and a lower navigation pane.

3.  Click to expand **Forward Lookup** and the domain where the zone and resource records that you want to delete are located. Click on the zone, and in the display pane, click **Current view**. Click **Resource Records**.

4.  In the display pane, locate and select the resource records that you want to delete.

6.  The **Delete DNS Resource Record** dialog box opens. Verify that the correct DNS server is selected. If it is not, click **DNS server** and select the server from which you want to delete the resource records. Click **OK**. IPAM deletes the resource records from the DNS server.
