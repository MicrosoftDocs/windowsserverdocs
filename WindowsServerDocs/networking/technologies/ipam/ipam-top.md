# IP Address Management (IPAM)

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

IP Address Management (IPAM) is an integrated suite of tools to enable end-to-end planning, deploying, managing and monitoring of your IP address infrastructure, with a rich user experience. IPAM automatically discovers IP address infrastructure servers and Domain Name System (DNS) servers on your network and enables you to manage them from a central interface.
