### To view resource records for an IP Address

1.  In Server Manager, click  **IPAM**. The IPAM client console appears.

2.  In the navigation pane, in **IP ADDRESS SPACE**, click **IP Address Inventory**. In the lower navigation pane, click either **IPv4** or **IPv6**. The IP address inventory appears in the display pane search view. Locate and select the IP address whose DNS resource records you want to view.
