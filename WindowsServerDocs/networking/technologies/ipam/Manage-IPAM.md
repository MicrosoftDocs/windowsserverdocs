This guide provides administration and troubleshooting information for the IP Address Management (IPAM) feature in  Windows Server 2016.

In  Windows Server 2016, IPAM supports DNS resource record, conditional forwarder, and DNS zone management for both domain-joined Active Directory-integrated and file-backed DNS servers. In addition, IPAM supports role-based access control and all functionality in previous versions of the technology.

This guide includes the following sections:

-   [DNS Resource Record Management](../../technologies/ipam/DNS-Resource-Record-Management.md)

-   [DNS Zone Management](../../technologies/ipam/DNS-Zone-Management.md)

-   [Manage Resources in Multiple Active Directory Forests](../../technologies/ipam/Manage-Resources-in-Multiple-Active-Directory-Forests.md)
