# Manage IPAM
This guide provides administration and troubleshooting information for the IP Address Management (IPAM) feature in Windows Server® 2016 Technical Preview.  
  
In Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview, IPAM supports DNS resource record, conditional forwarder, and DNS zone management for both domain-joined Active Directory-integrated and file-backed DNS servers. In addition, IPAM supports role-based access control and all functionality in previous versions of the technology.  
  
This guide includes the following sections:  
  
-   [DNS Resource Record Management](../../technologies/ipam/DNS-Resource-Record-Management.md)  
  
-   [DNS Zone Management](../../technologies/ipam/DNS-Zone-Management.md)  
  
-   [Manage Resources in Multiple Active Directory Forests](../../technologies/ipam/Manage-Resources-in-Multiple-Active-Directory-Forests.md)
