You can use this topic to create a DNS zone by using the IPAM client console.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, is the minimum required to perform this procedure.

### To create a DNS zone

1.  In Server Manager, click  **IPAM**. The IPAM client console appears.

2.  In the navigation pane, in **MONITOR AND MANAGE**, click **DNS and DHCP Servers**. In the display pane, click **Server Type**, and then click **DNS**. All DNS servers that are managed by IPAM are listed in the search results.

3.  Locate the server where you want to add a zone, and right-click the server.  Click **Create DNS zone**.
