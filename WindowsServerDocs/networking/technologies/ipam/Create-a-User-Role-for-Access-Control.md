# Create a User Role for Access Control

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

You can use this topic to create a new Access Control user role in the IPAM client console.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, is the minimum required to perform this procedure.

> [!NOTE]
> After you create a role, you can create an access policy to assign the role to a specific user or Active Directory group. For more information, see [Create an Access Policy](../../technologies/ipam/Create-an-Access-Policy.md).

### To create a role

1.  In Server Manager, click  **IPAM**. The IPAM client console appears.

2.  In the navigation pane, click **ACCESS CONTROL**, and in the lower navigation pane, click **Roles**.

3.  Right-click **Roles**, and then click **Add User Role**.

4.  The **Add or Edit Role** dialog box opens. In **Name**, type a name for the role that makes the role function clear. For example, if you want to create a role that allows Administrators to manage DNS SRV resource records, you might name the role **IPAMSrv**. If needed, scroll down in **Operations** to locate the type of operations you want to define for the role. For this example, scroll down to **DNS resource record management operations**.

5.  Expand **DNS resource record management operations**, and then locate **SRV record operations**.

6.  Expand and select **SRV record operations**, and then click **OK**.

7.  In the IPAM client console, click the role that you just created. In **Details View,** the permitted operations for the role are displayed.
