>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

You can use this topic to view DNS resource records for a DNS zone in the IPAM client console.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, is the minimum required to perform this procedure.

### To view DNS resource records for a zone

1.  In Server Manager, click  **IPAM**. The IPAM client console appears.

2.  In the navigation pane, in **MONITOR AND MANAGE**, click **DNS Zones**.  The navigation pane divides into an upper navigation pane and a lower navigation pane.

3.  In the lower navigation pane, click **Forward Lookup**, and then expand the domain and zone list to locate and select the zone you want to view. For example, if you have a zone named dublin, click **dublin**.
