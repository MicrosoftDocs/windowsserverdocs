Role-based access control allows you to specify access privileges at various levels, including the DNS server, DNS zone, and DNS resource record levels.  
By using role based access control, you can specify who has granular control over operations to create, edit, and delete different types of DNS resource records.  
  
You can configure access control so that users are restricted to the following permissions.  
  
-   Users can edit only specific DNS resource records  
  
-   Users can edit DNS resource records of a specific type, such as PTR or MX  
  
-   Users can edit DNS resource records for specific zones
