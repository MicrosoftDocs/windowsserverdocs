# Data Center Bridging \(DCB\)

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

You can use this topic for introductory information about Data Center Bridging \(DCB\).

DCB is a suite of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \(IEEE\) standards that enable Converged Fabrics in the data center, where storage, data networking, cluster Inter\-Process Communication \(IPC\), and management traffic all share the same Ethernet network infrastructure.

DCB provides hardware\-based bandwidth allocation to a specific type of network traffic, and enhances Ethernet transport reliability with the use of priority\-based flow control.

Hardware\-based bandwidth allocation is essential if traffic bypasses the operating system and is offloaded to a converged network adapter, which might support Internet Small Computer System Interface \(iSCSI\), Remote Direct Memory Access \(RDMA\) over Ethernet, or Fiber Channel over Ethernet \(FCoE\).

Priority\-based flow control is essential if the upper layer protocol, such as Fiber Channel, assumes a lossless underlying transport.

## DCB Protocols and Management Options

DCB consists of the following set of protocols.

- Enhanced Transmission Service \(ETS\) â€“ IEEE 802.1Qaz, which builds on the 802.1P and 802.1Q
standards
- Priority Flow Control \(PFC\), IEEE 802.1Qbb
- DCB Exchange Protocol \(DCBX\), IEEE 802.1AB, as extended in the 802.1Qaz standard.

The DCBX protocol allows you to configure DCB on a switch, which can then automatically configure an end device, such as a computer running Windows Server 2016.

If you prefer to manage DCB from a switch, you don't need to install DCB as a feature in Windows Server 2016, however this approach includes some limitations.

Because DCBX can only inform the host network adapter of ETS class sizes and PFC enablement, however, Windows Server hosts usually require that DCB is installed so that traffic is mapped to ETS classes.

Windows applications are usually not designed to participate in DCBX exchanges. Because of this, the host must be configured separately from the network switches, but with identical settings.

If you do choose to manage DCB from a switch, you can still view the configurations in Windows Server 2016 by using Windows PowerShell commands.

##  Important DCB functionality

Following is a list that summarizes the functionality that is provided by DCB.

1. Provides interoperability between DCB\-capable network adapters and DCB\-capable switches.

2. Provides a lossless Ethernet transport between a computer running Windows Server 2016 and its neighbor switch by turning on priority\-based flow control on the network adapter.

3. Provides the ability to allocate bandwidth to a Traffic Control \(TC\) by percentage, where the TC might consist of one or more classes of traffic that are differentiated by 802.1p traffic class \(priority\) indicators.

4. Enables server administrators or network administrators to assign an application to a particular traffic class or priority based on well-known protocols, well-known TCP/UDP port, or NetworkDirect port used by that application.

5. Provides DCB management through Windows Server 2016 Windows Management Instrumentation \(WMI\) and Windows PowerShell. For more information, see the section [Windows PowerShell Commands for DCB](#bkmk_wps) later in this topic, in addition to the following topics.

	- [NDIS QoS Requirements for Data Center Bridging](/windows-hardware/drivers/network/ndis-qos-requirements-for-data-center-bridging)

6. Provides DCB management through Windows Server 2016 Group Policy.

7. Supports the coexistence of Windows Server 2016 Quality of Service \(QoS\) solutions.

>[!NOTE]
>Before using any RDMA over Converged Ethernet \(RoCE\) version of RDMA, you must enable DCB. While not required for Internet Wide Area RDMA Protocol \(iWARP\) networks, testing has determined that all Ethernet\-based RDMA technologies work better with DCB. Because of this, you should consider using DCB for iWARP RDMA deployments. For more information, see [Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) and Switch Embedded Teaming (SET)](../../../virtualization/hyper-v-virtual-switch/RDMA-and-Switch-Embedded-Teaming.md).

##  Practical applications of DCB

Many organizations have large Fiber Channel \(FC\) storage area network \(SAN\) installations for storage service. FC SAN requires special network adapters on servers and FC switches in the network. These organizations typically also use Ethernet network adapters and switches.

In most cases, FC hardware is significantly more expensive to deploy than Ethernet hardware, which results in large capital expenditures. In addition, the requirement for separate Ethernet and FC SAN network adapter and switch hardware requires additional space, power, and cooling capacity in a datacenter, which results in additional, ongoing operational expenditures.

From a cost perspective, it is advantageous for many organizations to merge their FC technology with their Ethernet\-based hardware solution to provide both storage and data networking services.

### Using DCB for an Ethernet\-based converged fabric for storage and data networking

For organizations that already have a large FC SAN but want to migrate away from additional investment in the FC technology, DCB allows you to build an Ethernet based converged fabric for both storage and data networking. A DCB converged fabric can reduce the future total cost of ownership \(TCO\) and simplify management.

For hosters who have already adopted, or who plan to adopt, iSCSI as their storage solution, DCB can provide hardware\-assisted bandwidth reservation for iSCSI traffic to ensure performance isolation. And unlike other proprietary solutions, DCB is standards\-based - and therefore relatively easy to deploy and manage in a heterogeneous network environment.

A Windows Server 2016\-based implementation of DCB alleviates many of the issues that can occur when converged fabric solutions are provided by multiple original equipment manufacturers \(OEMs\).

Implementations of proprietary solutions provided by multiple OEMs might not interoperate with one another, might be difficult to manage, and will typically have different software maintenance schedules.

By contrast, Windows Server 2016 DCB is standards\-based, and you can deploy and manage DCB in a heterogeneous network.

There are DCB Windows PowerShell commands for both Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 R2. You can use all of the commands for Windows Server 2012 R2 in Windows Server 2016.
