# DHCP server events

DHCP server logs events for all changes that are made. In this article, learn where to view DHCP server events, and see the ID, category, and text for each event.

## View DHCP server event logs

DHCP audit logs are enabled by default, and don't significantly affect DNS server performance. To view DHCP Server event logs:

1. Select the Start button, type Event viewer, open Event viewer from the best match list.

1. In Event Viewer, navigate to **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **DHCP-Server**.

1. Depending on the kind of issue, an event is logged to one of the following event channels:

- [DHCP Server Operational Events](#dhcp-server-operational-events)
- [DHCP Server Administrative Events](#dhcp-server-administrative-events)
- [DHCP Server System Events](#dhcp-server-system-events)
- [DHCP Server Filter Notification Events](#dhcp-server-filter-notification-events)
- [DHCP Server Audit Events](#dhcp-server-audit-events)

## DHCP server operational events

DHCP server operational events log information about the server's operation. Whenever a scope is changed, an event is added.
