# Use Regular Expressions in NPS

> Applies to:  Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel)

This topic explains the use of regular expressions for pattern matching in NPS in Windows Server. You can use this syntax to specify the conditions of network policy attributes and RADIUS realms.

## Pattern-matching reference

You can use the following table as a reference source when creating regular expressions with pattern-matching syntax. Note that regular expression patterns are often surrounded by forward slashes (/).

|  Character  |  Description  |   Example                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
|     `\ `     | Indicates that the character that follows is a special character, or should be interpreted literally.  | `/n/ matches the character "n" while the sequence /\n/ matches a line feed or newline character.`  |
|     `^`     |                                                                 Matches the beginning of the input or line.                                                                  |                                                                 &nbsp;                                                                  |

## Examples for network policy attributes

The following examples describe the use of the pattern-matching syntax to specify network policy attributes:

- To specify all phone numbers within the 899 area code, the syntax is:

     `899.*`

- To specify a range of IP addresses that begin with 192.168.1, the syntax is:

    `192\.168\.1\..+`

## Examples for manipulation of the realm name in the User Name attribute

The following examples describe the use of the pattern-matching syntax to manipulate realm names for the User Name attribute, which is located on the **Attribute** tab in the properties of a connection request policy.

**To remove the realm portion of the User Name attribute**

In an outsourced dial-up scenario in which an Internet service provider \(ISP\) routes connection requests to an organization NPS, the ISP RADIUS proxy might require a realm name to route the authentication request. However, the NPS might not recognize the realm name portion of the user name. Therefore, the realm name must be removed by the ISP RADIUS proxy before it is forwarded to the organization NPS.

- Find: @microsoft\.com

- Replace:

**To replace <em>user@example.microsoft.com</em> with _example.microsoft.com\user_**

- Find:`(.*)@(.*)`

- Replace:`$2\$1`



**To replace _domain\user_ with _specific_domain\user_**

- Find:`(.*)\\(.*)`

- Replace: *specific_domain*`\$2`



<strong>To replace *user* with *user@specific_domain</strong>*

- Find:`$`

- Replace: @*specific_domain*

## Example for RADIUS message forwarding by a proxy server

You can create routing rules that forward RADIUS messages with a specified realm name to a set of RADIUS servers when NPS is used as a RADIUS proxy. Following is a recommended syntax for routing requests based on realm name.

- **NetBIOS name**: `WCOAST`
- **Pattern**:      `^wcoast\\`

In the following example, wcoast.microsoft.com is a unique user principal name (UPN) suffix for the DNS or Active Directory domain wcoast.microsoft.com. Using the supplied pattern, the NPS proxy can route messages based on domain NetBIOS name or UPN suffix.

- **NetBIOS name**: `WCOAST`
- **UPN suffix**:   `wcoast.microsoft.com`
- **Pattern**:      `^wcoast\\|@wcoast\.microsoft\.com$`
