The Windows Server 2016 Core Network Guide includes a section on planning and installing Network Policy Server \(NPS\), and the technologies presented in the guide serve as prerequisites for deploying NPS in an Active Directory domain. For more information, see the section "Deploy NPS1" in the Windows Server 2016 [Core Network Guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/networking/core-network-guide/core-network-guide#BKMK_deployNPS1).

## Deploy NPS Certificates for VPN and 802.1X Access

If you want to deploy authentication methods like Extensible Authentication Protocol \(EAP\) and Protected EAP that require the use of server certificates on your NPS, you can deploy NPS certificates with the guide [Deploy Server Certificates for 802.1X Wired and Wireless Deployments](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/networking/core-network-guide/cncg/server-certs/deploy-server-certificates-for-802.1x-wired-and-wireless-deployments).

## Deploy NPS for 802.1X Wireless Access

To deploy NPS for wireless access, you can use the guide [Deploy Password-Based 802.1X Authenticated Wireless Access](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/networking/core-network-guide/cncg/wireless/a-deploy-8021x-wireless-access).

## Deploy NPS for Windows 10 VPN Access

You can use NPS to process connection requests for Always On Virtual Private Network \(VPN\) connections for remote employees that are using computers and devices running Windows 10.

For more information, see the [Remote Access Always On VPN Deployment Guide for Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/always-on-vpn/deploy/always-on-vpn-deploy).
