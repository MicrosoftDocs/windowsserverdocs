# High-performance networking (HPN)

High-performance networks (HPNs) play a role in real-time data processing requirements. For example, activities such as datacenter replication, datacenter disaster recovery, and high-performance distributed computing require high volume data transfer and low network latency. HPNs with dynamic connection capabilities make high-performance network resources more accessible and manageable. 


The high-performance networking topics include:

- [Network offload and optimization technologies](network-offload-and-optimization.md)

  - [Software only (SO) features and technologies](hpn-software-only-features.md)

  - [Software and hardware (SH) integrated features and technologies](hpn-software-hardware-features.md)

  - [Hardware Only (HO) features and technologies](hpn-hardware-only-features.md)

  - [NIC advanced properties](hpn-nic-advanced-properties.md)

- [RSC in the vSwitch](rsc-in-the-vswitch.md)
