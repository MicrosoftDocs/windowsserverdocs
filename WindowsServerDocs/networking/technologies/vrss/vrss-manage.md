# Manage vRSS

In this topic, you use the Windows PowerShell commands to manage vRSS in virtual machines \(VMs\) and on Hyper\-V hosts.

>[!NOTE]
>For more information about the commands mentioned in this topic, see [Windows PowerShell Commands for RSS and vRSS](vrss-wps.md).

## VMQ on Hyper-V Hosts

On the Hyper-V host, you must use the keywords that control the VMQ processors.

**View the current settings:**

```PowerShell
Get-NetAdapterVmq
```

**Configure the VMQ settings:**

```PowerShell
Set-NetAdapterVmq
```


## vRSS on Hyper-V switch ports

On the Hyper-V host, you must also enable vRSS on the Hyper\-V Virtual Switch port.

**View the current settings:**

```PowerShell
Get-VMNetworkAdapter <vm-name> | fl

Get-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS | fl
```

Both of the following settings should be **True**.

- VrssEnabledRequested: True
- VrssEnabled: True

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Under some resource limitation conditions, a Hyper\-V Virtual Switch port might be unable to have this feature enabled. This is a temporary condition, and the feature may become available at a subsequent time.
>
>If **VrssEnabled** is **True**, then the feature is enabled for this Hyper\-V Virtual Switch portâ€”that is, for this VM or vNIC.

**Configure the switch port vRSS settings:**

```PowerShell
Set-VMNetworkAdapter <vm-name> -VrssEnabled $TRUE

Set-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS -VrssEnabled $TRUE
```

## vRSS in VMs and host vNICs

You can use the same commands used for native RSS to configure vRSS settings in VMs and host vNICs, which is also the way to enable RSS on host vNICs.

**View the current settings:**

```PowerShell
Get-NetAdapterRSS
```

**Configure vRSS settings:**

```PowerShell
Set-NetAdapterRss
```

>[!NOTE]
> Setting the profile inside the VM does not impact the scheduling of the work. Hyper\-V makes all the scheduling decisions and ignores the profile inside the VM.

## Disable vRSS

You can disable vRSS to disable any of the previously mentioned settings.

- Disable VMQ for the physical NIC or the VM.

  >[!CAUTION]
  >Disabling VMQ on the physical NIC severely impacts the ability of your Hyper\-V host to handle incoming packets.

- Disable vRSS for a VM on the Hyper\-V Virtual Switch port on the Hyper\-V host.

   ```PowerShell
   Set-VMNetworkAdapter <vm-name> -VrssEnabled $FALSE
   ```

- Disable vRSS for a host vNIC on the Hyper\-V Virtual Switch port on the Hyper\-V host.

   ```PowerShell
   Set-VMNetworkAdapter -ManagementOS -VrssEnabled $FALSE
   ```

- Disable RSS in the VM \(or host vNIC\) inside the VM \(or on the host\)

   ```PowerShell
   Disable-NetAdapterRSS *
   ```
