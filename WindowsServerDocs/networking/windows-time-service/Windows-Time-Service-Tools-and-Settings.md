# Windows Time service tools and settings

The Windows Time service (W32Time) synchronizes the date and time for all computers managed by Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). This article covers the various tools and settings used to manage W32Time.

By default, a computer that's joined to a domain synchronizes time through a domain hierarchy of time sources. However, sometimes a computer is manually configured to synchronize from a specific time source, perhaps because it was formerly not joined to a domain. In this case, you can reconfigure the computer to begin automatically sourcing its time from the domain hierarchy.

Most domain-joined computers have a time client type of Net Time 5 Directory Service (NT5DS), which means that they synchronize time from the domain hierarchy. An exception is the domain controller, which functions as the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations master for the root forest domain. The PDC emulator operations master in turn is configured to synchronize time with an external time source.

You can achieve down to one-millisecond time accuracy in your domain. For more information, see [Support boundary for high-accuracy time](support-boundary.md) and [Accurate Time for Windows Server 2016](accurate-time.md).

## Network port

W32Time follows the Network Time Protocol (NTP) specification, which requires the use of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 123 for all time synchronization. Whenever the computer synchronizes its clock or provides time to another computer, it happens over UDP port 123. W32Time reserves this port as the destination port.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - NTP servers typically listen on UDP port 123 for requests and respond from the same port, which is also true for the built-in W32Time NTP server.
> - You can enable or disable the built-in W32Time NTP client and NTP server independently. Both share UDP port 123 for their functions.
> - The built-in W32Time NTP client can only use UDP 123 as the source port.
> - If your computer has multiple network adapters (it's multi-homed), you can't enable W32Time based on a network adapter.

## Command-line parameters for W32Time

You can use the `w32tm` command to configure W32Time settings and diagnose computer time problems. The `w32tm` command is the preferred command-line tool for configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting W32Time. Membership in the local Administrators group is required to run this tool locally, and membership in the Domain Admins group is required to run this tool remotely.

To use `w32tm`, take the following steps:

1. Select **Start**, and then enter **cmd**. Right-click **Command Prompt**, and then select **Run as administrator**.
1. At the command prompt, enter **w32tm** followed by the applicable parameters.

### Set the client to use two time servers

To set a client computer to point to two different time servers, one named `ntpserver.contoso.com` and another named `clock.adatum.com`, run the following command:

```cmd
w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"ntpserver.contoso.com clock.adatum.com" /syncfromflags:manual /update
```

### Set the client to sync time automatically from a domain source

Suppose you have a client computer that currently synchronizes time by using a manually specified computer. To configure the client computer to synchronize time automatically from the Active Directory domain hierarchy, run the following command:

```cmd
w32tm /config /syncfromflags:domhier /update

net stop w32time

net start w32time
```

### Check the client time configuration

To check a client configuration from a Windows-based client computer that has a host name of `contosoW1`, run the following command:

```cmd
w32tm /query /computer:contosoW1 /configuration
```

The output of this command lists W32Time configuration parameters that are set for the client.

Since Windows Server 2016, improvements to the [time synchronization algorithms](./accurate-time.md) support alignment with Request for Comments (RFC) specifications. Therefore, if you want to set the local time client to point to multiple peers, we recommend that you prepare three or more time servers.

If you have only two time servers, you should specify the **NtpServer** `UseAsFallbackOnly` flag (0x2) to deprioritize one of them. For example, if you want to prioritize `ntpserver.contoso.com` over `clock.adatum.com`, run the following command:

```cmd
w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"ntpserver.contoso.com,0x8 clock.adatum.com,0x2" /syncfromflags:manual /update
```

Also, you can run the following command and read the value of `NtpServer` in the output:

```cmd
reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters
```

### Configure a computer clock reset

In order for `w32tm` to reset a computer clock, it first checks the offset `CurrentTimeOffset`, also known as `Phase Offset`, between the current time and the computer clock time to determine whether the offset is less than the `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset` value.  

- `CurrentTimeOffset` &le; `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset`: Adjust the computer clock gradually by using the clock rate.  
- `CurrentTimeOffset` &gt; `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset`: Set the computer clock immediately.  

To adjust the computer clock by using the clock rate, `w32tm` then calculates a `PhaseCorrection` value. This algorithm varies depending on the version of Windows:  

- Windows Server 2016 and later versions:  

  `PhaseCorrection_raw` = (`CurrentTimeOffset`) &divide; (16 &times; `PhaseCorrectRate` &times; `pollIntervalInSeconds`)  
  
  `MaximumCorrection` = (`CurrentTimeOffset`) &divide; (`UpdateInterval` &divide; 100)  
  
  `PhaseCorrection` = min(`PhaseCorrection_raw`, `MaximumCorrection`)  

- Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier versions:
  
  `PhaseCorrection` = (`CurrentTimeOffset`) &divide; (`PhaseCorrectRate` &times; `UpdateInterval`)  

All versions of Windows use the same final equation to check `PhaseCorrection`:  

`PhaseCorrection` &le; `SystemClockRate` &divide; 2  

> [!NOTE]  
> The following operating systems apply cumulative updates from KB5006744 onward, so they use the formula for Windows Server 2016 and later versions:
>
> - Windows Server 2025
> - Windows Server 2022
> - Windows Server 2019 version 1809
> - Windows 11
> - Windows 10 version 1809
>
> In these equations, `PhaseCorrectRate`, `UpdateInterval`, `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset`, and `SystemClockRate` are measured in units of clock ticks. On Windows systems, one millisecond equals 10,000 clock ticks.
>
> You can configure the `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset` value in the registry. However, the registry parameter is measured in seconds instead of clock ticks.

To see the `SystemClockRate` and `pollIntervalInSeconds` values (measured in seconds), open a Command Prompt window and then run the following command: `w32tm /query /status /verbose`. This command produces output that resembles the following lines:  

```output
Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)
Stratum: 1 (primary reference - syncd by radio clock)
Precision: -23 (119.209ns per tick)
Root Delay: 0.0003538s
Root Dispersion: 0.0100002s
ReferenceId: 0x00000000 (unspecified)
Last Successful Sync Time: 5/23/2023 7:51:39 PM
Source: VM IC Time Synchronization Provider
Poll Interval: 6 (64s)
 
Phase Offset: -0.0000013s
ClockRate: 0.0156250s
State Machine: 2 (Sync)
Time Source Flags: 3 (Authenticated Hardware )
Server Role: 0 (None)
Last Sync Error: 0 (The command completed successfully.)
Time since Last Good Sync Time: 15.7344985s
```

In the output, the poll interval is listed in clock ticks and in seconds. The equations use the value measured in seconds (the value in parentheses).

The output lists the clock rate in seconds. To calculate the `SystemClockRate` value in clock ticks, use the following formula:  

(`value in clock ticks`) = (`value in seconds`) &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000  

This formula uses the following conversion factors:

- One second equals 1,000 milliseconds.
- One millisecond equals 10,000 clock ticks on a Windows system, as described in [DateTime.Ticks Property](/dotnet/api/system.datetime.ticks).

For example:

- If `SystemClockRate` is 0.0156250 seconds, the value that the equation produces is 156,250 clock ticks.
- By extension, five minutes becomes 5 &times; 60 &times; 1000 &times; 10000 = 3,000,000,000 clock ticks.

The following examples show how to apply the phase correction calculations for Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier versions.  

#### Example: The system clock rate is off by four minutes

If your computer clock time is 11:05 and the actual current time is 11:09, `w32tm` uses the following values:

- `PhaseCorrectRate` = 1
- `UpdateInterval` = 30,000 clock ticks
- `SystemClockRate` = 156,000 clock ticks
- `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset` = 10 min = 600 seconds = 600 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 6,000,000,000 clock ticks
- `CurrentTimeOffset` = 4 min = 4 &times; 60 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 2,400,000,000 clock ticks

To reset the clock, `w32tm` checks the following condition:

Is `CurrentTimeOffset` &le; `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset`?

In this case, the condition has the following values, so it evaluates to true:

2,400,000,000 &le; 6,000,000,000

Next, `w32tm` checks the following condition:

Is (CurrentTimeOffset) &divide; (PhaseCorrectRate × UpdateInterval) &le; SystemClockRate &divide; 2?

In this case, the condition has the following values:

2,400,000,000 &divide; (30,000 × 1) &le; 156,000 &divide; 2, or 80,000 &le; 78,000

This condition is false. Therefore, `w32tm` sets the clock back immediately.

> [!NOTE]
> In this example, if you want to set the clock back slowly, you also have to adjust the values of `PhaseCorrectRate` or `UpdateInterval` in the registry to make sure that the equation result is true.

#### Example: The system clock rate is off by three minutes

If your computer clock time is 11:05 and the actual current time is 11:08, `w32tm` uses the following values:

- `PhaseCorrectRate` = 1
- `UpdateInterval` = 30,000 clock ticks
- `SystemClockRate` = 156,000 clock ticks
- `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset` = 10 min = 600 seconds = 600 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 6,000,000,000 clock ticks
- `CurrentTimeOffset` = 3 mins = 3 &times; 60 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 1,800,000,000 clock ticks

To reset the clock, `w32tm` checks the following condition:

Is `CurrentTimeOffset` &le; `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset`?

In this case, the condition has the following values, so it evaluates to true:

1,800,000,000 &le; 6,000,000,000

Next, `w32tm` checks the following condition:

Is (CurrentTimeOffset) &divide; (PhaseCorrectRate × UpdateInterval) &le; SystemClockRate &divide; 2?

In this case, the condition has the following values:

(1,800,000,000) &divide; (1 × 30,000) &le; 156,000 &divide; 2, or 60,000 &le; 78,000

This condition is true. The clock is set back slowly.

## Use Local Group Policy Editor

W32Time stores several configuration properties as registry entries. You can use Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in Local Group Policy Editor to configure most of this information. For example, you can use GPOs to configure a computer to be an NTP server or NTP client, configure the time synchronization mechanism, or configure a computer to be a reliable time source. You can also apply Group Policy settings for W32Time to domain controllers.

Windows stores W32Time policy information in the Local Group Policy Editor under **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Windows Time Service**. It stores configuration information that the policies define in the Windows registry, and then uses those registry entries to configure the registry entries specific to W32Time. As a result, the values defined by Group Policy overwrite any preexisting values in the W32Time section of the registry. Some of the preset GPO settings differ from the corresponding default W32Time registry entries.

The following table lists the policies that you can configure for W32Time and registry subkey equivalents that those policies affect.

|Group Policy |Registry locations<sup>1,</sup> <sup>2</sup> |
| --- | --- |
|Global Configuration Settings |W32Time<br />W32Time\Config<br />W32Time\Parameters |
|Time Providers\Configure Windows NTP Client |W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient |
|Time Providers\Enable Windows NTP Client |W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient |
|Time Providers\Enable Windows NTP Server |W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer |

<sup>1</sup> Subkey: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft`<br>
<sup>2</sup> Subkey: `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time`

> [!NOTE]
> When you remove a Group Policy setting, Windows removes the corresponding entry from the policy area of the registry.

### GPO default settings for W32Time

The following table lists default values for the **Global Configuration Settings** when they're enabled:

|Group Policy setting|Default value|

### GPO settings for an NTP Client

The following table lists the default Windows NTP client settings that are contained in **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Windows Time Service\Time Providers\Configure Windows NTP Client**.

|Group Policy setting|Default value|
|------------------------|-----------------|
|NtpServer|`time.windows.com`, 0x9|
|Type|**NT5DS**: Used for domain-joined computers<br>**NTP**: Used for non-domain-joined computers|
|CrossSiteSyncFlags|2|
|ResolvePeerBackoffMinutes|15|
|ResolvePeerBackoffMaxTimes|7|
|SpecialPollInterval|1024|
|EventLogFlags|0|

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Group Policy to set the `NtpServer` value as part of the **Configure Windows NTP Client** policy and apply it to a domain member, W32Time doesn't use the `NtpServer` registry value. To view your NTP configuration, open Command Prompt and run the following command: `w32tm /query /configuration`.

## W32Time registry reference

W32Time stores information under the following registry paths:

```registry
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Config
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer
```

> [!WARNING]
> This information is provided as a reference for use in troubleshooting and validation. Windows registry keys are used by W32Time to store critical information. Don't change these values. Modifications to the registry aren't validated by the registry editor or by Windows before they're applied. If the registry contains invalid values, Windows might experience unrecoverable errors.

Some of the parameters in the registry are measured in clock ticks and some are measured in seconds. To convert between the two units, see the explanation earlier in [Configure a computer clock reset](#configure-a-computer-clock-reset).

In the following table, *All versions* refers to all supported versions of Windows and Windows Server.

# [Config](#tab/config)

|Registry entry |Versions |Description |

|**ClockHoldoverPeriod** |Windows Server 2016 version 1709 and later versions; Windows 10 version 1709 and later versions |Indicates the maximum number of seconds a system clock can nominally hold its accuracy without synchronizing with a time source. If this period of time passes without W32Time obtaining new samples from any of its input providers, W32Time initiates a rediscovery of time sources. The default value is **7,800** seconds. |
|**EventLogFlags** |All versions |Controls which events the time service logs.<p><ul><li>**0x1**: Time jump</li><li>**0x2**: Source change</li></ul><p>The default value on domain members is **2**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **2**. |
|**FrequencyCorrectRate** |All versions |Controls the rate at which the clock is corrected. If this value is too small, the clock is unstable and overcorrects. If the value is too large, the clock takes a long time to synchronize. The default value on domain members is **4**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **4**.<p>Zero isn't a valid value for the **FrequencyCorrectRate** registry entry. |
|**HoldPeriod** |All versions |Controls the period of time for which spike detection is disabled in order to bring the local clock into synchronization quickly. A spike is a time sample indicating that time is off several seconds, and is received after good time samples return consistently. The default value on domain members is **5**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **5**. |
|**LargePhaseOffset** |All versions |Specifies that a time offset greater than or equal to this value in 10<sup>-7</sup> seconds is considered a spike.

The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **54,000** (15 hrs).|
|**MaxPollInterval** |All versions |Specifies the largest interval, in log base 2 seconds, allowed for the system polling interval. A system must poll according to the scheduled interval. A provider can refuse to produce samples when requested to do so. The default value for domain controllers is **10**. The default value for domain members is **15**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **15**. |
|**MaxPosPhaseCorrection** |All versions |Specifies the largest positive time correction in seconds that the service makes. If the service determines that a change larger than this value is required, it logs an event instead.<p>The value **0xFFFFFFFF** is a special case.

The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **54,000** (15 hrs). |
|**MinClockRate** |All versions |Maintained by W32Time. It contains reserved data that's used by the Windows operating system, and any changes to this setting can cause unpredictable results. The default value for domain members is **155,860**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **155,860**. |
|**MinPollInterval** |All versions |Specifies the smallest interval, in log base 2 seconds, allowed for the system polling interval. A system doesn't request samples more frequently than this value. A provider can produce samples at times other than the scheduled interval. The default value for domain controllers is **6**. The default value for domain members is **10**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **10**. |
|**PhaseCorrectRate** |All versions |Controls the rate at which the phase error is corrected. Specifying a small value corrects the phase error quickly but might cause the clock to become unstable. If the value is too large, it takes a longer time to correct the phase error. <p>The default value on domain members is **1**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **7**.<p>Zero isn't a valid value for the **PhaseCorrectRate** registry entry. |
|**PollAdjustFactor** |All versions |Controls the decision to increase or decrease the poll interval for the system. The larger the value, the smaller the amount of error that causes the poll interval to be decreased. The default value on domain members is **5**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **5**. |
|**SpikeWatchPeriod** |All versions |Specifies the amount of time that a suspicious offset must persist before it's accepted as correct (in seconds). The default value on domain members is **900**. The default value on stand-alone clients and workstations is **900**. |
|**TimeJumpAuditOffset** |All versions |Indicates the time jump audit threshold, in seconds. The offset is stored as an unsigned integer. If the time service adjusts the local clock by setting the clock directly, and the time correction is more than this value, the time service logs an audit event. |
|**UpdateInterval** |All versions |Specifies the interval (in 10ms unit) between phase correction adjustments. A value of 0 has the same effect as 1. The default values are:<ul><li>Domain controllers: **100**</li><li>Domain members: **30,000**</li><li>Stand-alone clients and servers: **360,000**</li></ul> |
|**UtilizeSslTimeData** |Windows versions later than Windows 10 build 1511 |Indicates whether W32Time uses multiple SSL timestamps to seed a clock that's grossly inaccurate. A value of **1** indicates multiple SSL timestamps are used.<p>The **UtilizeSslTimeData** registry value refers to the secure time seeding feature. For more information, see [Secure Time Seeding – improving time keeping in Windows](/archive/blogs/w32time/secure-time-seeding-improving-time-keeping-in-windows).<p>The default out-of-box value for all Windows versions with this feature is **1** except for Windows Server 2025, where the default value is **0**. Domain membership doesn't affect this setting.|

## Enhanced logging

The following registry entries aren't part of the W32Time default configuration, but you can add them to the registry to obtain enhanced logging capabilities. You can modify the information that's logged to the system event log by adjusting the **EventLogFlags** settings in the Group Policy Object Editor. By default, W32Time logs an event every time that it switches to a new time source.

To enable enhanced W32Time logging, add the following registry entries into the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Config` path.

|Entry |Versions |Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|**FileLogEntries** |All versions |Controls the number of entries created in the W32Time log file. The default value is **none**, which results in no logs of W32Time activity. Valid values are **0** to **300**. This value doesn't affect the event log entries that W32Time normally creates. |
|**FileLogName** |All versions |Controls the location and file name of the W32Time log. The default value is blank. It shouldn't be changed unless **FileLogEntries** is changed. A valid value is a full path and file name that W32Time uses to create the log file. This value doesn't affect the event log entries that W32Time normally creates. |
|**FileLogSize** |All versions |Controls the circular logging behavior of W32Time log files. When **FileLogEntries** and **FileLogName** are defined, this value is also defined. It contains the size in bytes that the log file can reach before it overwrites the oldest log entries with new entries. Use **1,000,000** or a larger value for this setting. This value doesn't affect the event log entries that W32Time normally creates. |
