# Windows Time service tools and settings

> Applies to: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 10

The Windows Time service (W32Time) synchronizes the date and time for all computers managed by Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). This article covers the different tools and settings used to manage the Windows Time service.

By default, a computer that is joined to a domain synchronizes time through a domain hierarchy of time sources. However, if a computer has been manually configured to synchronize from a specific time source, perhaps because it was formerly not joined to a domain, you can reconfigure the computer to begin automatically sourcing its time from the domain hierarchy.

Most domain-joined computers have a time client type of NT5DS, which means that they synchronize time from the domain hierarchy. An exception to this is the domain controller, which functions as the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations master for the root forest domain. The PDC emulator operations master in turn is usually configured to synchronize time with an external time source.

You can achieve down to one-millisecond time accuracy in your domain. For more information, see [Support boundary for high-accuracy time](support-boundary.md) and see [Accurate Time for Windows Server 2016](accurate-time.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't use the **Net time** command to configure or set a computer's clock time when the Windows Time service is running.
>
> Also, on older computers that run Windows XP or earlier, the **Net time /querysntp** command displays the name of a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server with which a computer is configured to synchronize, but that NTP server is used only when the computer's time client is configured as NTP or AllSync. This command has since been deprecated.

## Network port

The Windows Time service follows the Network Time Protocol (NTP) specification, which requires the use of UDP port 123 for all time synchronization. Whenever the computer synchronizes its clock or provides time to another computer, it happens over UDP port 123. This port is exclusively reserved by the Windows Time service.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a computer with multiple network adapters (is multi-homed), you cannot enable the Windows Time service based on a network adapter.

## <a id="windows-time-service-tools"></a> Using W32tm.exe

You can use the command-line tool W32tm.exe to configure Windows Time service settings and to diagnose computer time problems. W32tm.exe is the preferred command-line tool for configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting the Windows Time service. W32tm.exe is included with Windows XP and later and Windows Server 2003 and later.

Membership in the local **Administrators group** is required to run W32tm.exe locally, while membership in the **Domain Admins group** is required to run W32tm.exe remotely.

### Run W32tm.exe

1. In the Windows search bar, enter **cmd**.
1. Right-click **Command Prompt**, then select **Run as administrator**.
1. At the command prompt, enter **w32tm** followed by the applicable parameter, as described below:

### Set client to use two time servers

To set a client computer to point to two different time servers, one named `ntpserver.contoso.com` and another named `clock.adatum.com`, type the following command at the command prompt, and then press ENTER:

```cmd
w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"ntpserver.contoso.com clock.adatum.com" /syncfromflags:manual /update
```

### Set client to sync time automatically from a domain source

To configure a client computer that is currently synchronizing time using a manually-specified computer to synchronize time automatically from the AD domain hierarchy, run the following following:

```cmd
w32tm /config /syncfromflags:domhier /update

net stop w32time

net start w32time
```

### Check client time configuration

To check a client configuration from a Windows-based client computer that has a host name of `contosoW1`, run the following command:

```cmd
W32tm /query /computer:contosoW1 /configuration
```

The output of this command displays a list of W32time configuration parameters that are set for the client.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Windows Server 2016 has improved the time synchronization algorithms](./accurate-time.md) to align with RFC specifications. Therefore, if you want to set the local time client to point to multiple peers, we recommended that you prepare three or more different time servers.
>
> If you have only two time servers, you should specify the **Ntpserver**`UseAsFallbackOnly` flag (0x2)to de-prioritize one of them. For example, if you want to prioritize `ntpserver.contoso.com` over `clock.adatum.com`, run the following command.
> ```cmd
> w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"ntpserver.contoso.com,0x8 clock.adatum.com,0xa" /syncfromflags:manual /update
> ```

Additionally, you can run the following command and read the value of `NtpServer` in the output:

```cmd
reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters
```

### Configure computer clock reset

In order for W32tm.exe to reset a computer clock, the computer clock time offset from the current time (`CurrentTimeOffset`) must be less than the `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset` value while also satisfying the following at the same time:

- Windows Server 2016 and later:

  > |`CurrentTimeOffset`| &divide; (16 &times; `PhaseCorrectRate` &times; `pollIntervalInSeconds`) &le; `SystemClockRate` &divide; 2

- Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier:

  > |`CurrentTimeOffset`| &divide; (`PhaseCorrectRate` &times; `UpdateInterval`) &le; `SystemClockRate` &divide; 2

The values for `CurrentTimeOffset`, `SystemClockRate`, `PhaseCorrectRate`, and `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset` are all measured in clock ticks, where 1 ms = 10,000 clock ticks on a Windows system.

To get the `SystemClockRate` value, you can use the following command and convert it from seconds to clock ticks by using the formula of (seconds &times; 1,000 &times; 10,0000):

```cmd
W32tm /query /status /verbose

ClockRate: 0.0156000s
```

The following examples show how to apply these calculations for Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier. Using 156,000 seconds as an example, the `SystemClockRate` value would be (0.0156000 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000) = 156,000 clock ticks.

#### Example: System clock rate off by four minutes

Your computer clock time is 11:05 and the actual current time is 11:09:

> PhaseCorrectRate = 1
>
> UpdateInterval = 30,000 clock ticks
>
> SystemClockRate = 156,000 clock ticks
>
> MaxAllowedPhaseOffset = 10 min = 600 seconds = 600 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 6,000,000,000 clock ticks
>
> |CurrentTimeOffset| = 4 min = 4 &times; 60 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 2,400,000,000 clock ticks
>
Is `CurrentTimeOffset` &le; `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset`?

> 2,400,000,000 &le; 6,000,000,000: TRUE

AND does it satisfy the above equation?

> (|CurrentTimeOffset| &divide; (PhaseCorrectRate &times; UpdateInterval) &le; SystemClockRate &divide; 2)

Is 2,400,000,000 / (30,000 &times; 1) &le; 156,000 &divide; 2

80,000 &le; 78,000: FALSE

Therefore, W32tm.exe would set the clock back immediately.

> [!NOTE]
> In this case, if you want to set the clock back slowly, you would also have to adjust the values of `PhaseCorrectRate` or `UpdateInterval` in the registry to make sure that the equation result is TRUE.

#### Example: System clock rate off by three minutes

Your computer clock time is 11:05 and the actual current time is 11:08:

> PhaseCorrectRate = 1
>
> UpdateInterval = 30,000 clock ticks
>
> SystemClockRate = 156,000 clock ticks
>
> MaxAllowedPhaseOffset = 10 min = 600 seconds = 600 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 6,000,000,000 clock ticks
>
> |CurrentTimeOffset| = 3 mins = 3 &times; 60 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 1,800,000,000 clock ticks
>
Is `CurrentTimeOffset` &le; `MaxAllowedPhaseOffset`?
>
> 1,800,000,000 &le; 6,000,000,000: TRUE

AND does it satisfy the above equation?

> (|CurrentTimeOffset| &divide; (PhaseCorrectRate &times; UpdateInterval) &le; SystemClockRate &divide; 2)

 Is 3 mins &times; (1,800,000,000) &divide; (30,000 &times; 1) &le; 156,000 &divide; 2

> Is 60,000 &le; 78,000: TRUE

In this case, the clock will be set back slowly.

## Using Local Group Policy Editor

The Windows Time service stores a number of configuration properties as registry entries. You can use Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in Local Group Policy Editor to configure most of this information. For example, you can use GPOs to configure a computer to be an NTPServer or NTPClient, configure the time synchronization mechanism, or configure a computer to be a reliable time source.

> [!NOTE]
> Group Policy settings for the Windows Time service can be applied on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 domain controllers and can be applied to computers running Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2.

Windows stores the Windows Time service policy information in the Local Group Policy Editor under `Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Windows Time Service`. It stores configuration information that the policies define in the Windows registry, and then uses those registry entries to configure the registry entries specific to the Windows Time service. As a result, the values defined by Group Policy overwrite any pre-existing values in the Windows Time service section of the registry. Some of the preset GPO settings differ from the corresponding default Windows Time service registry entries.

For example, suppose you edit policy settings in the **Time Providers\Configure Windows NTP Client** policy. Windows loads these settings into the policy area of the registry under the following subkey:

> `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\W32time\TimeProviders\NtpClient`

Then Windows uses the policy settings to configure the related Windows Time service registry entries under the following subkey:

> `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Time Providers\NTPClient\\`

The following table lists the policies that you can configure for the Windows Time service, and the registry subkeys that those policies affect.

> [!NOTE]
> When you remove a Group Policy setting, Windows removes the corresponding entry from the policy area of the registry.

|Group Policy<sup>1</sup> |Registry locations<sup>2,</sup> <sup>3</sup> |
| --- | --- |
|Global Configuration Settings |W32Time<br />W32Time\Config<br />W32Time\Parameters |
|Time Providers\Configure Windows NTP Client |W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient |
|Time Providers\Enable Windows NTP Client |W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient |
|Time Providers\Enable Windows NTP Server |W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer |

<sup>1</sup> `Category path: Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Windows Time Service`<br>
<sup>2</sup> Subkey: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft`<br>
<sup>3</sup> Subkey: `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`

## Windows registry reference

> [!WARNING]
> This information is provided as a reference for use in troubleshooting and validation. Windows registry keys are used by W32Time to store critical information. Don't change these values. Modifications to the registry are not validated by the registry editor or by Windows before they are applied. If the registry contains invalid values, Windows may experience unrecoverable errors.

The Windows Time service stores information in the registry at the **HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time** path under the following subkeys:

- [**\Config**](#config)
- [**\Parameters**](#parameters)
- [**\TimeProviders\NtpClient**](#ntpclient)
- [**\TimeProviders\NtpServer**](#ntpserver)

In the following tables, "All versions" refers to Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019. 

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the parameters in the registry are measured in clock ticks and some are measured in seconds. To convert the time from clock ticks to seconds, use these conversion factors:
> - 1 minute = 60 sec
> - 1 sec = 1000 ms
> - 1 ms = 10,000 clock ticks on a Windows system, as described at [DateTime.Ticks Property](/dotnet/api/system.datetime.ticks).
>
> For example, 5 minutes becomes 5 &times; 60 &times; 1000 &times; 10000 = 3,000,000,000 clock ticks.

### <a id="config"></a> Config entries

The `Config` subkey entries are located at `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Config`.

|Registry entry |Versions |Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|**AnnounceFlags** |All versions |Controls whether this computer is marked as a reliable time server. A computer is not marked as reliable unless it is also marked as a time server.<ul><li>**0x00**. Not a time server</li><li>**0x01**. Always time server</li><li>**0x02**. Automatic time server</li><li>**0x04**. Always-reliable time server</li><li>**0x08**. Automatic reliable time server</li></ul><br />The default value for domain members is **10**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **10**. |
|**ChainDisable** | |Controls whether or not the chaining mechanism is disabled. If chaining is disabled (set to 0), a read-only domain controller (RODC) can synchronize with any domain controller, but hosts that do not have their passwords cached on the RODC will not be able to synchronize with the RODC. This is a boolean setting, and the default value is **0**.|
|**ChainEntryTimeout** | |Specifies the maximum amount of time that an entry can remain in the chaining table before the entry is considered to be expired. Expired entries may be removed when the next request or response is processed. The default value is **16** (seconds). |
|**ChainLoggingRate** | |Controls the frequency at which an event that indicates the number of successful and unsuccessful chaining attempts is logged to the System log in Event Viewer. The default is **30** (minutes). |
|**ChainMaxEntries** | |Controls the maximum number of entries that are allowed in the chaining table. If the chaining table is full and no expired entries can be removed, any incoming requests are discarded. The default value is **128** (entries). |
|**ChainMaxHostEntries** | |Controls the maximum number of entries that are allowed in the chaining table for a particular host. The default value is **4** (entries). |
|**ClockAdjustmentAuditLimit** |Windows Server 2016 Version 1709 and later versions; Windows 10 Version 1709 and later versions |Specifies the smallest local clock adjustments that may be logged to the W32time service event log on the target computer. The default value is **800** (parts per million - PPM). |
|**ClockHoldoverPeriod** |Windows Server 2016 Version 1709 and later versions; Windows 10 Version 1709 and later versions |Indicates the maximum number of seconds a system clock can nominally hold its accuracy without synchronizing with a time source. If this period of time passes without W32time obtaining new samples from any of its input providers, W32time initiates a rediscovery of time sources. Default: 7,800 seconds. |
|**EventLogFlags** |All versions |Controls which events that the time service logs.<ul><li>**0x1**. Time jump</li><li>**0x2**. Source change</li></ul>The default value on domain members is **2**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **2**. |
|**FrequencyCorrectRate** |All versions |Controls the rate at which the clock is corrected. If this value is too small, the clock is unstable and overcorrects. If the value is too large, the clock takes a long time to synchronize. The default value on domain members is **4**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **4**.<p>**Note** <br />Zero is not a valid value for the **FrequencyCorrectRate** registry entry. On Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2008 , and Windows Server 2008 R2 computers, if the value is set to **0**, the Windows Time service automatically changes it to **1**. |
|**HoldPeriod** |All versions |Controls the period of time for which spike detection is disabled in order to bring the local clock into synchronization quickly. A spike is a time sample indicating that time is off a number of seconds, and is usually received after good time samples have been returned consistently. The default value on domain members is **5**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **5**. |
|**LargePhaseOffset** |All versions |Specifies that a time offset greater than or equal to this value in 10<sup>-7</sup> seconds is considered a spike. A network disruption such as a large amount of traffic might cause a spike. A spike will be ignored unless it persists for a long period of time. The default value on domain members is **50000000**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **50000000**. |
|**LastClockRate** |All versions |Maintained by W32Time. It contains reserved data that is used by the Windows operating system, and any changes to this setting can cause unpredictable results. The default value on domain members is **156250**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **156250**. |
|**LocalClockDispersion** |All versions |Controls the dispersion (in seconds) that you must assume when the only time source is the built-in CMOS clock. The default value on domain members is **10**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **10**. |
|**MaxAllowedPhaseOffset** |All versions |Specifies the maximum offset (in seconds) for which W32Time attempts to adjust the computer clock by using the clock rate. When the offset exceeds this rate, W32Time sets the computer clock directly. The default value for domain members is **300**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **1**. |
|**MaxClockRate** |All versions |Maintained by W32Time. It contains reserved data that is used by the Windows operating system, and any changes to this setting can cause unpredictable results. The default value for domain members is **155860**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **155860**. |
|**MaxNegPhaseCorrection** |All versions |Specifies the largest negative time correction, in seconds, that the service makes. If the service determines that a change larger than this is required, it logs an event instead.<p>**Note**<br />The value **0xFFFFFFFF** is a special case. This value means that the service always corrects the time.<p>The default value for domain members is **0xFFFFFFFF**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **54,000** (15 hrs).|
|**MaxPollInterval** |All versions |Specifies the largest interval, in log2 seconds, allowed for the system polling interval. Note that while a system must poll according to the scheduled interval, a provider can refuse to produce samples when requested to do so. The default value for domain controllers is **10**. The default value for domain members is **15**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **15**. |
|**MaxPosPhaseCorrection** |All versions |Specifies the largest positive time correction in seconds that the service makes. If the service determines that a change larger than this is required, it logs an event instead.<p>**Note**<br />The value **0xFFFFFFFF** is a special case. This value means that the service always corrects the time.<p>The default value for domain members is **0xFFFFFFFF**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **54,000** (15 hrs). |
|**MinClockRate** |All versions |Maintained by W32Time. It contains reserved data that is used by the Windows operating system, and any changes to this setting can cause unpredictable results. The default value for domain members is **155860**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **155860**. |
|**MinPollInterval** |All versions |Specifies the smallest interval, in log base 2 seconds, allowed for the system polling interval. Note that while a system does not request samples more frequently than this, a provider can produce samples at times other than the scheduled interval. The default value for domain controllers is **6**. The default value for domain members is **10**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **10**. |
|**PhaseCorrectRate** |All versions |Controls the rate at which the phase error is corrected. Specifying a small value corrects the phase error quickly, but might cause the clock to become unstable. If the value is too large, it takes a longer time to correct the phase error.<p>The default value on domain members is **1**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **7**.<p>**Note**<br />Zero is not a valid value for the **PhaseCorrectRate** registry entry. On Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2008, and  Windows Server 2008 R2 computers, if the value is set to **0**, the Windows Time service automatically changes it to **1**. |
|**PollAdjustFactor** |All versions |Controls the decision to increase or decrease the poll interval for the system. The larger the value, the smaller the amount of error that causes the poll interval to be decreased. The default value on domain members is **5**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **5**. |
|**RequireSecureTimeSyncRequests** |Windows 8 and later versions |Controls whether or not the DC will respond to time sync requests that use older authentication protocols. If enabled (set to **1**), the DC will not respond to requests using such protocols. This is a boolean setting, and the default value is **0**. |
|**SpikeWatchPeriod** |All versions |Specifies the amount of time that a suspicious offset must persist before it is accepted as correct (in seconds). The default value on domain members is **900**. The default value on stand-alone clients and workstations is **900**. |
|**TimeJumpAuditOffset** |All versions |An unsigned integer that indicates the time jump audit threshold, in seconds. If the time service adjusts the local clock by setting the clock directly, and the time correction is more than this value, then the time service logs an audit event. |
|**UpdateInterval** |All versions |Specifies the number of clock ticks between phase correction adjustments. The default value for domain controllers is **100**. The default value for domain members is **30,000**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **360,000**.<p>**Note**<br />Zero is not a valid value for the **UpdateInterval** registry entry.

### Enhanced logging

The following registry entries are not a part of the W32Time default configuration but can be added to the registry to obtain enhanced logging capabilities. The information logged to the System Event log can be modified by changing values for the **EventLogFlags** setting in the Group Policy Object Editor. By default, the Windows Time service logs an event every time that it switches to a new time source.

In order to enable W32Time logging, add the following registry entries:

|Entry |Versions |Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|FileLogEntries |All versions |Controls the number of entries created in the Windows Time log file. The default value is none, which does not log any Windows Time activity. Valid values are **0** to **300**. This value does not affect the event log entries normally created by Windows Time |
|FileLogName |All versions |Controls the location and file name of the Windows Time log. The default value is blank, and should not be changed unless **FileLogEntries** is changed. A valid value is a full path and file name that Windows Time will use to create the log file. This value does not affect the event log entries normally created by Windows Time. |
|FileLogSize |All versions |Controls the circular logging behavior of Windows Time log files. When **FileLogEntries** and **FileLogName** are defined, defines the size, in bytes, to allow the log file to reach before overwriting the oldest log entries with new entries. Please use **1000000** or larger value for this setting. This value does not affect the event log entries normally created by Windows Time. |
