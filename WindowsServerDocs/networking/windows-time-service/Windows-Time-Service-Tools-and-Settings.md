# Windows Time Service Tools and Settings
>Applies to: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 10 or later

In this topic, you learn about tools and settings for Windows Time service (W32Time). 

If you only want to synchronize time for a domain-joined client computer, see [Configure a client computer for automatic domain time synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-r2-and-2008/cc816884%28v%3dws.10%29). For additional topics about how to configure Windows Time service, see [Where to Find Windows Time Service Configuration Information](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/networking/windows-time-service/windows-time-service-top).  

> [!CAUTION]  
> You should not use the Net time command to configure or set time when the Windows Time service is running.  
>
> Also, on older computers that run Windows XP or earlier, the command Net time /querysntp displays the name of a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server with which a computer is configured to synchronize, but that NTP server is used only when the computer's time client is configured as NTP or AllSync. That command has since been deprecated.  

Most domain member computers have a time client type of NT5DS, which means that they synchronize time from the domain hierarchy. The only typical exception to this is the domain controller that functions as the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations master of the forest root domain, which is usually configured to synchronize time with an external time source. To view the time client configuration of a computer, run the W32tm /query /configuration command from an elevated Command Prompt in starting in Windows Server 2008, and Windows Vista, and read the **Type** line in the command output. For more information, see [How Windows Time Service Works](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/networking/windows-time-service/How-the-Windows-Time-Service-Works). You can run the command **reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters** and read the value of **NtpServer** in the command output.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Prior to Windows Server 2016, the W32Time service was not designed to meet time-sensitive application needs.  However, updates to Windows Server 2016 now allow you to implement a solution for 1ms accuracy in your domain.  See [Windows 2016 Accurate Time](accurate-time.md) and  [Support boundary to configure the Windows Time service for high-accuracy environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/networking/windows-time-service/support-boundary) for more information.  

## Windows Time Service Tools  
The following tools are associated with the Windows Time service.  

#### W32tm.exe: Windows Time  
**Category**  

This tool is installed as part of Windows XP, Windows Vista,  Windows 7 , Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2,  Windows Server 2008 , and  Windows Server 2008 R2  default installations.  

**Version compatibility**  

This tool works on Windows XP, Windows Vista,  Windows 7 , Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2,  Windows Server 2008 , and  Windows Server 2008 R2  default installations.  

W32tm.exe is used to configure Windows Time service settings. It can also be used to diagnose problems with the time service. W32tm.exe is the preferred command line tool for configuring, monitoring, or troubleshooting the Windows Time service.  

The following tables describe the parameters that are used with W32tm.exe.

If no domain name is given, or neither the domain nor computers option is specified, the default domain is used. This option might be used more than once.<br /><br />computers - monitors the given list of computers. Computer names are separated by commas, with no spaces.

## Windows Time Service Registry Entries
The following registry entries are associated with the Windows Time service.  

This information is provided as a reference for use in troubleshooting or verifying that the required settings are applied. It is recommended that you do not directly edit the registry unless there is no other alternative. Modifications to the registry are not validated by the registry editor or by Windows before they are applied, and as a result, incorrect values can be stored. This can result in unrecoverable errors in the system.  

When possible, use Group Policy or other Windows tools, such as Microsoft Management Console (MMC), to accomplish tasks rather than editing the registry directly. If you must edit the registry, use extreme caution.  

> [!WARNING]  
> Some of the preset values that are configured in the System Administrative template file (System.adm) for the Group Policy object (GPO) settings are different from the corresponding default registry entries. If you plan to use a GPO to configure any Windows Time setting, be sure that you review [Preset values for the Windows Time service Group Policy settings are different from the corresponding Windows Time service registry entries in Windows Server 2003](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186066). This issue applies to  Windows Server 2008 R2 ,  Windows Server 2008 , Windows Server 2003 R2, and Windows Server 2003.  

Many registry entries for the Windows Time service are the same as the Group Policy setting of the same name. The Group Policy settings correspond to the registry entries of the same name located in:  

>**HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\\**


There are several registry keys at this registry location. The Windows Time settings are stored in values across all of these keys:

* [Parameters](#hklmsystemcurrentcontrolsetservicesw32timeparameters)
* [Config](#hklmsystemcurrentcontrolsetservicesw32timeconfig)
* [NtpClient](#hklmsystemcurrentcontrolsetservicesw32timetimeprovidersntpclient)
* [NtpServer](#hklmsystemcurrentcontrolsetservicesw32timetimeprovidersntpserver)

Many of the values in the W32Time section of the registry are used internally by W32Time to store information. These values should not be manually changed at any time. Do not modify any of the settings in this section unless you are familiar with the setting and are certain that the new value will work as expected. The following registry entries are located under:

**HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time**  

When you create a policy, the settings are configured in the following location, which does not take precedence over the next location:

**HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\W32time**

The W32time key is created with the policy.  When you remove the policy, then this key is also removed.

The other default location:

**HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32time**

Some of the parameters are stored in clock ticks in the registry and some are in seconds. To convert the time from clock ticks to seconds:  

-   1 minute = 60 sec  

-   1 sec = 1000 ms  

-   1 ms = 10,000 clock ticks on a Windows system, as described at [DateTime.Ticks Property](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.datetime.ticks?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=netframework-4.7.2#System_DateTime_Ticks).  

For example, 5 minutes would become 5\*60\*1000\*10000 = 3000000000 clock ticks. 

All versions include Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008 , and  Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012R2, Windows Server 2016.  Some entries are only availalbe on newer Windows versions.

The following registry entries must be added in order to enable W32Time logging:  

|Registry Entry|Version|Description|
|------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------|
|FileLogEntries|All|Entry controls the amount of entries created in the Windows Time log file. The default value is none, which does not log any Windows Time activity. Valid values are 0 to 300. This value does not affect the event log entries normally created by Windows Time|
|FileLogName|All|Entry controls the location and file name of the Windows Time log. The default value is blank, and should not be changed unless **FileLogEntries** is changed. A valid value is a full path and file name that Windows Time will use to create the log file. This value does not affect the event log entries normally created by Windows Time.  |
|FileLogSize|All|Entry controls the circular logging behavior of Windows Time log files. When **FileLogEntries** and **FileLogName** are defined, Entry defines the size, in bytes, to allow the log file to reach before overwriting the oldest log entries with new entries. Please use 1000000 or larger value for this setting. This value does not affect the event log entries normally created by Windows Time.  |

#### MaxAllowedPhaseOffset information
In order for W32Time to set the computer clock gradually, the offset must be less than the **MaxAllowedPhaseOffset** value and satisfy the following equation at the same time:  

* Windows Server 2016 and later versions:
   ```  
    |CurrentTimeOffset| / (16*PhaseCorrectRate*pollIntervalInSeconds) <= SystemClockRate / 2  
   ``` 
* Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier versions:
   ```  
   |CurrentTimeOffset| / (PhaseCorrectRate*UpdateInterval) <= SystemClockRate / 2  
   ``` 
The **CurrentTimeOffset** value is measured in clock ticks, where 1ms = 10,000 clock ticks on a Windows system.  

**SystemClockRate** and **PhaseCorrectRate** are also measured in clock ticks. To get the **SystemClockRate** value, you can use the following command and convert it from seconds to clock ticks by using the formula of seconds*1000\*10000:  

```  
W32tm /query /status /verbose  
ClockRate: 0.0156000s  
```  

**SystemclockRate** is the rate of the clock on the system. Using 156000 seconds as an example, the **SystemclockRate** value would be = 0.0156000 \* 1000 \* 10000 = 156000 clock ticks.  

**MaxAllowedPhaseOffset** is also in seconds. To convert it to clock ticks, multiply **MaxAllowedPhaseOffset**\*1000\*10000.  

The following examples show how to apply these calculations when you use Windows Server 2012 R2 or an earlier version.

**Example 1**: Time differs by 4 minutes (for example, your time is 11:05 and the time sample that you received from a peer and believe to be correct is 11:09).
  
```
phasecorrectRate = 1  

UpdateInterval = 30000 (clock ticks)  

systemclockRate = 156000 (clock ticks)  

MaxAllowedPhaseOffset = 10min = 600 seconds = 600*1000\*10000=6000000000 clock ticks  

|currentTimeOffset| = 4mins = 4*60\*1000\*10000 = 2400000000 ticks  

Is CurrentTimeOffset <= MaxAllowedPhaseOffset?  

2400000000 <= 6000000000 = TRUE  
```

AND does it satisfy the above equation? 

```
(|CurrentTimeOffset| / (PhaseCorrectRate*UpdateInterval) <= SystemClockRate / 2)  

Is 2,400,000,000 / (30000*1) <= 156000/2  

Is 80,000 <= 78,000  

NO/FALSE  
```  

Therefore W32tm would set the clock back immediately.  

> [!NOTE]  
> In this case, if you want to set the clock back slowly, you would also have to adjust the values of **PhaseCorrectRate** or **updateInterval** in the registry to make sure that the equation result is **TRUE**.  

**Example 2**: Time differs by 3 minutes. 
 
```  
phasecorrectRate = 1  

UpdateInterval = 30000 (clock ticks)  

systemclockRate = 156000 (clock ticks)  

MaxAllowedPhaseOffset = 10min = 600 seconds = 600*1000\*10000=6000000000 clock ticks  

currentTimeOffset = 3mins = 3*60\*1000\*10000 = 1800000000 clock ticks  

Is CurrentTimeOffset <= MaxAllowedPhaseOffset?  

1800000000 <= 6000000000 = TRUE  
```  

AND does it satisfy the above equation?

```
(|CurrentTimeOffset| / (PhaseCorrectRate*UpdateInterval) <= SystemClockRate / 2)  

Is 3 mins (1,800,000,000) / (30000*1) <= 156000/2  

Is 60,000 <= 78,000  

YES/TRUE  
```  

In this case the clock will be set back slowly.  

## Windows Time Service Group Policy Settings  
You can configure most W32Time parameters by using the Group Policy Object Editor. This includes configuring a computer to be an NTPServer or NTPClient, configuring the time synchronization mechanism, and configuring a computer to be a reliable time source.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Group Policy settings for the Windows Time service can be configured on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2,  Windows Server 2008 , and  Windows Server 2008 R2  domain controllers and can be applied only to computers running Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2,  Windows Server 2008 , and  Windows Server 2008 R2 .  

You can find the Group Policy settings used to configure W32Time in the Group Policy Object Editor snap-in in the following locations:  

-   Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Windows Time Service  

    Configure **Global Configuration Settings** here.  

-   Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Windows Time Service\Time Providers  

    Configure **Windows NTP Client** settings here.  

    Enable **Windows NTP Client** here.  

    Enable **Windows NTP Server** here.  

> [!WARNING]  
> Some of the preset values that are configured in the System Administrative template file (System.adm) for the Group Policy object (GPO) settings are different from the corresponding default registry entries. If you plan to use a GPO to configure any Windows Time setting, be sure that you review [Preset values for the Windows Time service Group Policy settings are different from the corresponding Windows Time service registry entries in Windows Server 2003](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186066). This issue applies to  Windows Server 2008 R2 ,  Windows Server 2008 , Windows Server 2003 R2, and Windows Server 2003.  

The following table lists the global Group Policy settings that are associated with the Windows Time service and the pre-set value associated with each setting. For more information about each setting, see the corresponding registry entries in [Windows Time Service Registry Entries](#windows-time-service-registry-entries) earlier in this subject. The following settings are contained in a single GPO called **Global Configuration Settings**.  

**Global Group Policy Settings Associated with Windows Time**  

|Group Policy Setting|Pre-Set Value|  
|------------------------|------------------|  
|AnnounceFlags|10|  
|EventLogFlags|2|

For more information about each setting, see the corresponding registry entries in [Windows Time Service Registry Entries](#windows-time-service-registry-entries) earlier in this subject.  

**NTP Client Group Policy Settings Associated with Windows Time**  

|Group Policy Setting|Default Value|  
|------------------------|-----------------|  
|NtpServer|time.windows.com,0x1|  
|Type|Default options:<br /><br />-   **NTP.** Use on computers that are not joined to a domain.<br />-   **NT5DS.** Use on computers that are joined to a domain.|  
|CrossSiteSyncFlags|2|  
|ResolvePeerBackoffMinutes|15|  
|ResolvePeerBackoffMaxTimes|7|  
|SpecialPollInterval|3600|  
|EventLogFlags|0|  

## Network Ports Used by the Windows Time Service  
Windows Time follows the NTP specification, which requires the use of UDP port 123 for all time synchronization communication. This port is reserved by Windows Time and remains reserved at all times. Whenever the computer synchronizes its clock or provides time to another computer, that communication is performed on UDP port 123.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you have a computer with multiple network adapters (also called a multihomed computer), you cannot selectively enable the Windows Time service based on the network adapter.
