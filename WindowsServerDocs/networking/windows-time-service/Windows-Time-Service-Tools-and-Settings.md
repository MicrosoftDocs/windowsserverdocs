# Windows Time service tools and settings

> Applies to: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows 10 or later

In this topic, you learn about tools and settings for Windows Time service (W32Time).

If you want to synchronize time for only a domain-joined client computer, see [Configure a client computer for automatic domain time synchronization](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-r2-and-2008/cc816884%28v%3dws.10%29). For additional topics about how to configure Windows Time service, see [Where to Find Windows Time Service Configuration Information](windows-time-service-top.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> You should not use the **Net time** command to configure or set time when the Windows Time service is running.
>
> Also, on older computers that run Windows XP or earlier versions, the **Net time /querysntp** command displays the name of a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server with which a computer is configured to synchronize, but that NTP server is used only when the computer's time client is configured as NTP or AllSync. That command has since been deprecated.

Most domain member computers have a time client type of NT5DS, which means that they synchronize time from the domain hierarchy. The only typical exception to this is the domain controller that functions as the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations master of the forest root domain. The PDC emulator operations master is usually configured to synchronize time with an external time source. To view the time client configuration of a computer (starting in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista), run the **W32tm /query /configuration** command from an elevated Command Prompt, and read the **Type** line in the command output. For more information, see [How Windows Time Service Works](How-the-Windows-Time-Service-Works.md). Additionally, you can run the **reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters** command and read the value of **NtpServer** in the command output.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prior to Windows Server 2016, the W32Time service was not designed to meet time-sensitive application needs. However, updates to Windows Server 2016 now allow you to implement a solution for one-millisecond accuracy in your domain. For more information, see [Windows 2016 Accurate Time](accurate-time.md) and [Support boundary to configure the Windows Time service for high-accuracy environments](support-boundary.md).

## Windows Time service tools

The following tool is associated with the Windows Time service.

### W32tm.exe: Windows Time

**Category**

This tool is part of the default installation of Windows (Windows XP and later versions) and Windows Server (Windows Server 2003 and later versions).

**Version compatibility**

This tool works on the default installation of Windows (Windows XP and later versions) and Windows Server (Windows Server 2003 and later versions).

You can use W32tm.exe to configure Windows Time service settings and to diagnose time service problems. W32tm.exe is the preferred command-line tool for configuring, monitoring, or troubleshooting the Windows Time service.

The following tables describe the parameters that you can use with W32tm.exe.

For more information about **W32tm.exe**, see [Windows help](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4338813/windows-help?os=windows-10).

**Examples**

If you want to set the local Windows Time client to point to two different time servers, one named ntpserver.contoso.com and another named clock.adatum.com, type the following command at the command line, and then press ENTER:

```cmd
w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"ntpserver.contoso.com clock.adatum.com" /syncfromflags:manual /update
```

For a list of valid NTP servers that are available on the Internet for external time synchronization, see [A list of the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) time servers that are available on the Internet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=60401).

If you want to check the Windows Time client configuration from a Windows-based client computer that has a host name of CONTOSOW1, run the following command:

```cmd
W32tm /query /computer:contosoW1 /configuration
```

The output of this command is a list of configuration parameters that are set for the Windows Time client.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Windows Server 2016 has improved the time synchronization algorithms](./accurate-time.md) to align with RFC specifications. Therefore, if you want to set the local Windows Time client to point to multiple peers, it is highly recommended that you prepare three or more different time servers.
>
> If you have only two time servers, you should specify the **UseAsFallbackOnly** flag (0x2) to de-prioritize one of them. For instance, if you want to prioritize ntpserver.contoso.com over clock.adatum.com, run the following command.
> ```cmd
> w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"ntpserver.contoso.com,0x8 clock.adatum.com,0xa" /syncfromflags:manual /update
> ```
> For the meaning of the specified flag, see ["HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters" subkey entries](#parameters).

## Using Group Policy to configure the Windows Time service

The Windows Time service stores a number of configuration properties as registry entries. You can use Group Policy Objects to configure most of this information. For example, you can use GPOs to configure a computer to be an NTPServer or NTPClient, configure the time synchronization mechanism, or configure a computer to be a reliable time source.

> [!NOTE]
> Group Policy settings for the Windows Time service can be configured on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 domain controllers and can be applied only to computers running Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2.

Windows stores the Windows Time service policy information in the W32Time.admx administrative template file, under **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Windows Time Service**. It stores the configuration information that the policies define in the registry, and uses those registry entries to configure the registry entries for the Windows Time service. As a result, the values defined by Group Policy overwrite any pre-existing values in the Windows Time service section of the registry.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the preset GPO settings differ from the corresponding default registry entries. If you plan to use a GPO to configure any Windows Time setting, be sure that you review [Preset values for the Windows Time service Group Policy settings are different from the corresponding Windows Time service registry entries in Windows Server 2003](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186066). This issue applies to Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003 R2, and Windows Server 2003.

For example, suppose you edit policy settings in the **Configure Windows NTP Client** policy.

Your changes are stored in the following location in the administrative template:

> **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Windows Time Service\Time Providers\ Configure Windows NTP Client**

Windows loads these settings into the policy area of the registry under the following subkey:

> **HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\W32time\TimeProviders\NtpClient**

Then Windows uses the policy settings to configure the related Windows Time service registry entries under the following subkey:

> **HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Time Providers\NTPClient\\**

The following table lists the policies that you can configure for the Windows Time service, and the registry subkeys that those policies affect.

> [!NOTE]
> When you remove a Group Policy setting, Windows removes the corresponding entry from the policy area of the registry.

|Policy<sup>1</sup> |Registry locations<sup>2,</sup> <sup>3</sup> |
| --- | --- |
|Global Configuration Settings |W32Time<br />W32Time\Config<br />W32Time\Parameters |
|Time Providers\Configure Windows NTP Client |W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient |
|Time Providers\Enable Windows NTP Client |W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient |
|Time Providers\Enable Windows NTP Server |W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer |

> <sup>1</sup> Category path: **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Windows Time Service**
> <sup>2</sup> Subkey: **HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft**
> <sup>3</sup> Subkey: **HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services**

## Enabling W32Time logging

The following three registry entries are not a part of the W32Time default configuration but can be added to the registry to obtain increased logging capabilities. The information logged to the System Event log can be modified by changing value for the **EventLogFlags** setting in the Group Policy Object Editor. By default, the time service logs an event every time that it switches to a new time source.

In order to enable W32Time logging, add the following registry entries:

|Registry Entry |Versions |Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|**FileLogEntries** |All versions |Controls the number of entries created in the Windows Time log file. The default value is none, which does not log any Windows Time activity. Valid values are **0** to **300**. This value does not affect the event log entries normally created by Windows Time |
|**FileLogName** |All versions |Controls the location and file name of the Windows Time log. The default value is blank, and should not be changed unless **FileLogEntries** is changed. A valid value is a full path and file name that Windows Time will use to create the log file. This value does not affect the event log entries normally created by Windows Time. |
|**FileLogSize** |All versions |Controls the circular logging behavior of Windows Time log files. When **FileLogEntries** and **FileLogName** are defined, Entry defines the size, in bytes, to allow the log file to reach before overwriting the oldest log entries with new entries. Please use **1000000** or larger value for this setting. This value does not affect the event log entries normally created by Windows Time. |

## Configuring how Windows Time service resets the computer clock

In order for W32Time to set the computer clock gradually, the offset must be less than the **MaxAllowedPhaseOffset** value and satisfy the following equation at the same time:

- Windows Server 2016 and later versions:

  > |**CurrentTimeOffset**| &divide; (16 &times; **PhaseCorrectRate** &times; **pollIntervalInSeconds**) &le; **SystemClockRate** &divide; 2

- Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier versions:

  > |**CurrentTimeOffset**| &divide; (**PhaseCorrectRate** &times; **UpdateInterval**) &le; **SystemClockRate** &divide; 2

The **CurrentTimeOffset** value is measured in clock ticks, where 1 ms = 10,000 clock ticks on a Windows system.

**SystemClockRate** and **PhaseCorrectRate** are also measured in clock ticks. To get the **SystemClockRate** value, you can use the following command and convert it from seconds to clock ticks by using the formula of *seconds* &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000:

```cmd
W32tm /query /status /verbose
ClockRate: 0.0156000s
```

**SystemClockRate** is the rate of the clock on the system. Using 156,000 seconds as an example, the **SystemClockRate** value would be 0.0156000 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 156,000 clock ticks.

**MaxAllowedPhaseOffset** is also measured in seconds. To convert it to clock ticks, multiply **MaxAllowedPhaseOffset** &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000.

The following examples show how to apply these calculations when you use Windows Server 2012 R2 or an earlier version.

**Example 1: Time differs by four minutes**

Your time is 11:05 and the time sample that you received from a peer and believe to be correct is 11:09.

> **PhaseCorrectRate** = 1
>
> **UpdateInterval** = 30,000 clock ticks
>
> **SystemClockRate** = 156,000 clock ticks
>
> **MaxAllowedPhaseOffset** = 10 min = 600 seconds = 600 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 6,000,000,000 clock ticks
>
> |**CurrentTimeOffset**| = 4 min = 4 &times; 60 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 2,400,000,000 clock ticks
>
> Is **CurrentTimeOffset** &le; **MaxAllowedPhaseOffset**?
>
> 2,400,000,000 &le; 6,000,000,000: TRUE

AND does it satisfy the above equation?

> (|**CurrentTimeOffset**| &divide; (**PhaseCorrectRate** &times; **UpdateInterval**) &le; **SystemClockRate** &divide; 2)

Is 2,400,000,000 / (30,000 &times; 1) &le; 156,000 &divide; 2

80,000 &le; 78,000: FALSE

Therefore, W32tm would set the clock back immediately.

> [!NOTE]
> In this case, if you want to set the clock back slowly, you would also have to adjust the values of **PhaseCorrectRate** or **UpdateInterval** in the registry to make sure that the equation result is **TRUE**.

**Example 2: Time differs by three minutes**

> **PhaseCorrectRate** = 1
>
> **UpdateInterval** = 30,000 clock ticks
>
> SystemClockRate = 156,000 clock ticks
>
> **MaxAllowedPhaseOffset** = 10 min = 600 seconds = 600 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 6,000,000,000 clock ticks
>
> |**CurrentTimeOffset**| = 3 mins = 3 &times; 60 &times; 1,000 &times; 10,000 = 1,800,000,000 clock ticks
>
> Is |**CurrentTimeOffset**| &le; **MaxAllowedPhaseOffset**?
>
> 1,800,000,000 &le; 6,000,000,000: TRUE

AND does it satisfy the above equation?

> (|**CurrentTimeOffset**| &divide; (**PhaseCorrectRate** &times; **UpdateInterval**) &le; **SystemClockRate** &divide; 2)
>
> Is 3 mins &times; (1,800,000,000) &divide; (30,000 &times; 1) &le; 156,000 &divide; 2
>
> Is 60,000 &le; 78,000: TRUE

In this case, the clock will be set back slowly.

## Reference: Windows Time service registry entries

> [!WARNING]
> The information about these registry entries is provided as a reference for use in troubleshooting or verifying that the required settings are applied. Many of the values in the W32Time section of the registry are used internally by W32Time to store information. Do not manually change these values. Modifications to the registry are not validated by the registry editor or by Windows before they are applied. If the registry contains invalid values, Windows may experience unrecoverable errors.

Windows Time service stores information under the following registry subkeys:

- [**HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Config**](#config)
- [**HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters**](#parameters)
- [**HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient**](#ntpclient)
- [**HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer**](#ntpserver)

Additionally, for troubleshooting purposes, you can [add entries in order to configure logs](#enabling-w32time-logging).

In the following tables, "All versions" refers to versions of Windows that include Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019. Some entries are only available on later Windows versions.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the parameters in the registry are measured in clock ticks and some are measured in seconds. To convert the time from clock ticks to seconds, use these conversion factors:
> - 1 minute = 60 sec
> - 1 sec = 1000 ms
> - 1 ms = 10,000 clock ticks on a Windows system, as described at [DateTime.Ticks Property](/dotnet/api/system.datetime.ticks).
>
> For example, 5 minutes becomes 5 &times; 60 &times; 1000 &times; 10000 = 3,000,000,000 clock ticks.

### <a id="config"></a>"HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Config" subkey entries

|Registry entry |Versions |Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|**AnnounceFlags** |All versions |Controls whether this computer is marked as a reliable time server. A computer is not marked as reliable unless it is also marked as a time server.<ul><li>**0x00**. Not a time server</li><li>**0x01**. Always time server</li><li>**0x02**. Automatic time server</li><li>**0x04**. Always-reliable time server</li><li>**0x08**. Automatic reliable time server</li></ul><br />The default value for domain members is **10**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **10**. |
|**ChainDisable** | |Controls whether or not the chaining mechanism is disabled. If chaining is disabled (set to 0), a read-only domain controller (RODC) can synchronize with any domain controller, but hosts that do not have their passwords cached on the RODC will not be able to synchronize with the RODC. This is a boolean setting, and the default value is **0**.|
|**ChainEntryTimeout** | |Specifies the maximum amount of time that an entry can remain in the chaining table before the entry is considered to be expired. Expired entries may be removed when the next request or response is processed. The default value is **16** (seconds). |
|**ChainLoggingRate** | |Controls the frequency at which an event that indicates the number of successful and unsuccessful chaining attempts is logged to the System log in Event Viewer. The default is **30** (minutes). |
|**ChainMaxEntries** | |Controls the maximum number of entries that are allowed in the chaining table. If the chaining table is full and no expired entries can be removed, any incoming requests are discarded. The default value is **128** (entries). |
|**ChainMaxHostEntries** | |Controls the maximum number of entries that are allowed in the chaining table for a particular host. The default value is **4** (entries). |
|**ClockAdjustmentAuditLimit** |Windows Server 2016 Version 1709 and later versions; Windows 10 Version 1709 and later versions |Specifies the smallest local clock adjustments that may be logged to the W32time service event log on the target computer. The default value is **800** (parts per million - PPM). |
|**ClockHoldoverPeriod** |Windows Server 2016 Version 1709 and later versions; Windows 10 Version 1709 and later versions |Indicates the maximum number of seconds a system clock can nominally hold its accuracy without synchronizing with a time source. If this period of time passes without W32time obtaining new samples from any of its input providers, W32time initiates a rediscovery of time sources. Default: 7,800 seconds. |
|**EventLogFlags** |All versions |Controls which events that the time service logs.<ul><li>**0x1**. Time jump</li><li>**0x2**. Source change</li></ul>The default value on domain members is **2**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **2**. |
|**FrequencyCorrectRate** |All versions |Controls the rate at which the clock is corrected. If this value is too small, the clock is unstable and overcorrects. If the value is too large, the clock takes a long time to synchronize. The default value on domain members is **4**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **4**.<p>**Note** <br />Zero is not a valid value for the **FrequencyCorrectRate** registry entry. On Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2008 , and Windows Server 2008 R2 computers, if the value is set to **0**, the Windows Time service automatically changes it to **1**. |
|**HoldPeriod** |All versions |Controls the period of time for which spike detection is disabled in order to bring the local clock into synchronization quickly. A spike is a time sample indicating that time is off a number of seconds, and is usually received after good time samples have been returned consistently. The default value on domain members is **5**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **5**. |
|**LargePhaseOffset** |All versions |Specifies that a time offset greater than or equal to this value in 10<sup>-7</sup> seconds is considered a spike. A network disruption such as a large amount of traffic might cause a spike. A spike will be ignored unless it persists for a long period of time. The default value on domain members is **50000000**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **50000000**. |
|**LastClockRate** |All versions |Maintained by W32Time. It contains reserved data that is used by the Windows operating system, and any changes to this setting can cause unpredictable results. The default value on domain members is **156250**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **156250**. |
|**LocalClockDispersion** |All versions |Controls the dispersion (in seconds) that you must assume when the only time source is the built-in CMOS clock. The default value on domain members is **10**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **10**. |
|**MaxAllowedPhaseOffset** |All versions |Specifies the maximum offset (in seconds) for which W32Time attempts to adjust the computer clock by using the clock rate. When the offset exceeds this rate, W32Time sets the computer clock directly. The default value for domain members is **300**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **1**. For more information, see [Configuring how Windows Time service resets the computer clock](#configuring-how-windows-time-service-resets-the-computer-clock). |
|**MaxClockRate** |All versions |Maintained by W32Time. It contains reserved data that is used by the Windows operating system, and any changes to this setting can cause unpredictable results. The default value for domain members is **155860**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **155860**. |
|**MaxNegPhaseCorrection** |All versions |Specifies the largest negative time correction, in seconds, that the service makes. If the service determines that a change larger than this is required, it logs an event instead.<p>**Note**<br />The value **0xFFFFFFFF** is a special case. This value means that the service always corrects the time.<p>The default value for domain members is **0xFFFFFFFF**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **54,000** (15 hrs).|
|**MaxPollInterval** |All versions |Specifies the largest interval, in log2 seconds, allowed for the system polling interval. Note that while a system must poll according to the scheduled interval, a provider can refuse to produce samples when requested to do so. The default value for domain controllers is **10**. The default value for domain members is **15**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **15**. |
|**MaxPosPhaseCorrection** |All versions |Specifies the largest positive time correction in seconds that the service makes. If the service determines that a change larger than this is required, it logs an event instead.<p>**Note**<br />The value **0xFFFFFFFF** is a special case. This value means that the service always corrects the time.<p>The default value for domain members is **0xFFFFFFFF**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **54,000** (15 hrs). |
|**MinClockRate** |All versions |Maintained by W32Time. It contains reserved data that is used by the Windows operating system, and any changes to this setting can cause unpredictable results. The default value for domain members is **155860**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **155860**. |
|**MinPollInterval** |All versions |Specifies the smallest interval, in log2 seconds, allowed for the system polling interval. Note that while a system does not request samples more frequently than this, a provider can produce samples at times other than the scheduled interval. The default value for domain controllers is **6**. The default value for domain members is **10**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **10**. |
|**PhaseCorrectRate** |All versions |Controls the rate at which the phase error is corrected. Specifying a small value corrects the phase error quickly, but might cause the clock to become unstable. If the value is too large, it takes a longer time to correct the phase error.<p>The default value on domain members is **1**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **7**.<p>**Note**<br />Zero is not a valid value for the **PhaseCorrectRate** registry entry. On Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2008, and  Windows Server 2008 R2 computers, if the value is set to **0**, the Windows Time service automatically changes it to **1**. |
|**PollAdjustFactor** |All versions |Controls the decision to increase or decrease the poll interval for the system. The larger the value, the smaller the amount of error that causes the poll interval to be decreased. The default value on domain members is **5**. The default value on stand-alone clients and servers is **5**. |
|**RequireSecureTimeSyncRequests** |Windows 8 and later versions |Controls whether or not the DC will respond to time sync requests that use older authentication protocols. If enabled (set to **1**), the DC will not respond to requests using such protocols. This is a boolean setting, and the default value is **0**. |
|**SpikeWatchPeriod** |All versions |Specifies the amount of time that a suspicious offset must persist before it is accepted as correct (in seconds). The default value on domain members is **900**. The default value on stand-alone clients and workstations is **900**. |
|**TimeJumpAuditOffset** |All versions |An unsigned integer that indicates the time jump audit threshold, in seconds. If the time service adjusts the local clock by setting the clock directly, and the time correction is more than this value, then the time service logs an audit event. |
|**UpdateInterval** |All versions |Specifies the number of clock ticks between phase correction adjustments. The default value for domain controllers is **100**. The default value for domain members is **30,000**. The default value for stand-alone clients and servers is **360,000**.<p>**Note**<br />Zero is not a valid value for the **UpdateInterval** registry entry. On computers running Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2, if the value is set to **0**, the Windows Time service automatically changes it to **1**.|
|**UtilizeSslTimeData** |Windows versions later than Windows 10 build 1511 |Value of **1** indicates that W32Time uses multiple SSL timestamps to Seed a clock that is grossly inaccurate. |

## Reference: Network ports that the Windows Time service uses

Windows Time follows the NTP specification, which requires the use of UDP port 123 for all time synchronization communication. This port is reserved by Windows Time and remains reserved at all times. Whenever the computer synchronizes its clock or provides time to another computer, that communication is performed on UDP port 123.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a computer that has multiple network adapters (also called a *multihomed* computer), you cannot selectively enable the Windows Time service based on the network adapter.
