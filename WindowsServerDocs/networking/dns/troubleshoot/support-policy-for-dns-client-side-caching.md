# Support policy for DNS client-side caching on DNS clients

Windows contains a client-side DNS cache. Microsoft recommends not to disable DNS client-side caching on DNS clients. A configuration in which DNS client-side caching is disabled is not supported.

## Support policy

Microsoft does not guarantee that a resolution will be found for issues that involve unsupported devices or configuration. If no resolution is found, the cost of an investigation into the incident is not refunded. If it is not agreed that a solution is not guaranteed, Microsoft Support will not fix the problem and will refund the cost of investigating the incident.
