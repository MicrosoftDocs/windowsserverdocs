>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

You can use this topic to learn about BranchCache modes and to select the best modes for your deployment.

You can use this guide to deploy BranchCache in the following modes and mode combinations.

-   All branch offices are configured for distributed cache mode.

-   All branch offices are configured for hosted cache mode and have a hosted cache server on site.

-   Some branch offices are configured for distributed cache mode and some branch offices have a hosted cache server on site and are configured for hosted cache mode.

The following illustration depicts a dual mode installation, with one branch office configured for distributed cache mode and one branch office configured for hosted cache mode.
