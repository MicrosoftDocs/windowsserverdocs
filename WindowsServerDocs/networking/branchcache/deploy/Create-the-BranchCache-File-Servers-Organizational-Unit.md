You can use this procedure to create an organizational unit (OU) in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) for BranchCache file servers.

### To create the BranchCache file servers organizational unit

1.  On a computer where AD DS is installed, in Server Manager, click **Tools**, and then click **Active Directory Users and Computers**. The Active Directory Users and Computers console opens.

2.  In the Active Directory Users and Computers console, right-click the domain to which you want to add an OU. For example, if your domain is named example.com, right click **example.com**. Point to **New**, and then click **Organizational Unit**. The **New Object - Organizational Unit** dialog box opens.

3.  In the **New Object - Organizational Unit** dialog box, in **Name**, type a name for the new OU. For example, if you want to name the OU BranchCache file servers, type **BranchCache file servers**, and then click **OK**.
