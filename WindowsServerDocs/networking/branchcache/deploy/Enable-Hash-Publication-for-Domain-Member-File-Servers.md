# Enable Hash Publication for Domain Member File Servers

When you're using Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), you can use domain Group Policy to enable BranchCache hash publication for multiple file servers. To do so, you must create an organizational unit (OU), add file servers to the OU, create a BranchCache hash publication Group Policy Object (GPO), and then configure the GPO.

See the following topics to enable hash publication for multiple file servers.

-   [Create the BranchCache File Servers Organizational Unit](../../branchcache/deploy/Create-the-BranchCache-File-Servers-Organizational-Unit.md)

-   [Move File Servers to the BranchCache File Servers Organizational Unit](../../branchcache/deploy/Move-File-Servers-to-the-BranchCache-File-Servers-Organizational-Unit.md)

-   [Create the BranchCache Hash Publication Group Policy Object](../../branchcache/deploy/Create-the-BranchCache-Hash-Publication-Group-Policy-Object.md)

-   [Configure the BranchCache Hash Publication Group Policy Object](../../branchcache/deploy/Configure-the-BranchCache-Hash-Publication-Group-Policy-Object.md)
