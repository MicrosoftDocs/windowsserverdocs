# Configure the File Services server role

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

You can deploy BranchCache file server-based content servers on computers running Windows Server 2016 and the File Services server role with the **BranchCache for network files** role service installed.  
  
-   To install a BranchCache content server on a computer that does not already have File Services installed, see [Install a New File Server as a Content Server](../../branchcache/deploy/Install-a-New-File-Server-as-a-Content-Server.md).  
  
-   To install a BranchCache content server on a computer that is already configured with the File Services server role, see [Configure an Existing File Server as a Content Server](../../branchcache/deploy/Configure-an-Existing-File-Server-as-a-Content-Server.md).
