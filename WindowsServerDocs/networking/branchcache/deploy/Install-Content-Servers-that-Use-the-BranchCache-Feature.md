# Install Content Servers that Use the BranchCache Feature

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

To deploy content servers that are Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS)  Web servers, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  Web servers, and Background Intelligent Transfer service (BITS)-based application servers, such as Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager branch distribution site system servers, you must install the BranchCache feature, start the BranchCache service, and (for WSUS servers only) perform additional configuration steps.  
  
See the following topics to deploy content servers.
