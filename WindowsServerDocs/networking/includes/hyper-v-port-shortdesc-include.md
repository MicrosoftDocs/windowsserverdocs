With Hyper-V Port, NIC Teams configured on Hyper-V hosts give VMs independent MAC addresses.  The VMs MAC address or the VM ported connected to the Hyper-V switch, can be used to divide network traffic between NIC Team members. You cannot configure NIC Teams that you create within VMs with the Hyper-V Port load balancing mode. Instead, use the Address Hash mode.
