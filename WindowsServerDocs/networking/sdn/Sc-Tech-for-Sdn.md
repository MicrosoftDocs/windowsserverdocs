# System Center Technologies for SDN

>Applies to: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

System Center includes the following technologies for use with Software Defined Networking (SDN):

-   [System Center Operations Manager](#bkmk_scom)

-   [System Center Virtual Machine Manager](#bkmk_scvmm)


## <a name="bkmk_scom"></a>System Center Operations Manager
System Center 2019 and 2016 Operations Manager provide infrastructure monitoring that is flexible and cost-effective, helps ensure the predictable performance and availability of vital applications, and offer comprehensive monitoring for your datacenter and cloud, both private and public.

For more information, see [Operations Manager](/system-center/scom/welcome?view=sc-om-2019)

## <a name="bkmk_scvmm"></a>System Center Virtual Machine Manager
With System Center 2019 and 2016 Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), you can:

- Provision and manage virtual networks at scale.
- Deploy and manage the SDN infrastructure, including network controllers, software load balancers, and gateways.
- Define and control virtual network policies centrally and link them to your applications or workloads.

  When your workload is deployed or moved, the network configuration adjusts itself automatically. This is important because it removes the need for manual reconfiguration of network hardware, thereby reducing operational complexity while saving your valuable resources for higher-impact work.
- Helps you to control traffic flow between virtual networks, including the ability to define guaranteed bandwidth for your critical applications and workloads.


For more information, see [Set up a Software Defined Network (SDN) infrastructure in the VMM fabric](/system-center/vmm/deploy-sdn).
