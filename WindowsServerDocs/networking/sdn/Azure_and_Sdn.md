# Microsoft Azure and Software Defined Networking

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform: a growing collection of integrated services - compute, storage, data, networking, and app - that help you move faster, do more, and save money.  
  
Microsoft's approach to software defined networking includes designing, building, and operating global-scale datacenter networks for services like Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Azure global datacenters perform tens of thousands of network changes every day, which is possible only because of software defined networking.  
  
Microsoft Azure runs on the same Windows Server and Hyper-V platform that are included in Windows Server. Windows Server and System Center include improvements and best practices from Microsoft's experience in operating global scale datacenter networks like Microsoft Azure to you so that you can deploy the same technologies for flexibility, automation, and control when using software designed networking technologies.
