# Microsoft Azure and Software Defined Networking

>Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2; Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform: a growing collection of integrated services - compute, storage, data, networking, and app - that help you move faster, do more, and save money.

The Microsoft approach to Software Defined Networking (SDN) includes designing, building, and operating global-scale datacenter networks for services like Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Azure global datacenters perform tens of thousands of network changes every day, which is possible only because of SDN.

Microsoft Azure runs on the same Windows Server and Hyper-V platform that are included in Windows Server. Windows Server and System Center include improvements and best practices based on Microsoft experience in operating global scale datacenter networks like Microsoft Azure so that you can deploy the same technologies for flexibility, automation, and control when using SDN technologies.
