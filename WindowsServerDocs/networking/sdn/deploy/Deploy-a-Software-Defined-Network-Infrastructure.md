# Deploy a Software Defined Network infrastructure

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

Deploy Microsoft's Software Defined Networking (SDN) infrastructure.   
  
These deployments include all the technologies you need for a fully functional infrastructure, including Hyper-V Network Virtualization (HNV), network controllers, software load balancers (SLB/MUX), and gateways.  
  
## Set up SDN infrastructure in the VMM fabric



  
-   [Set up a Software Defined Network (SDN) infrastructure in the VMM fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/system-center/vmm/deploy-sdn)  
  
    Use this method if you want to incorporate System Center Virtual Machine Manger (VMM) to manage your SDN infrastructure.  
 
## Deploy SDN infrastructure using scripts
 
-   [Deploy a Software Defined Network infrastructure using scripts](../../sdn/deploy/Deploy-a-Software-Defined-Network-infrastructure-using-scripts.md)  
  
    Use this method if you do not want to use VMM to manage your SDN infrastructure, or if you have another management method.  


## Deploy individual SDN technologies instead of an entire infrastructure  
 If you want to deploy individual SDN technologies instead of an entire infrastructure, see:  
[Deploy Software Defined Network Technologies using Windows PowerShell](Deploy-Software-Defined-Network-Technologies-using-Windows-PowerShell.md).
