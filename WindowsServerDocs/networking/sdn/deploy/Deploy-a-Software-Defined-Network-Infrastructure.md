# Deploy a Software Defined Network infrastructure

>Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Azure Stack HCI, versions 21H2 and 20H2

Deploy Microsoft's Software Defined Networking (SDN) infrastructure.

These deployments include all the technologies you need for a fully functional infrastructure, including Hyper-V Network Virtualization (HNV), network controllers, software load balancers (SLB/MUX), and gateways.

## Set up SDN infrastructure in the VMM fabric




-   [Set up a Software Defined Network (SDN) infrastructure in the VMM fabric](/system-center/vmm/deploy-sdn)

    Use this method if you want to incorporate System Center Virtual Machine Manger (VMM) to manage your SDN infrastructure.

## Deploy SDN infrastructure using scripts

-   [Deploy a Software Defined Network infrastructure using scripts](../../sdn/deploy/Deploy-a-Software-Defined-Network-infrastructure-using-scripts.md)

    Use this method if you do not want to use VMM to manage your SDN infrastructure, or if you have another management method.


## Deploy individual SDN technologies instead of an entire infrastructure
 If you want to deploy individual SDN technologies instead of an entire infrastructure, see:
[Deploy Software Defined Network Technologies using Windows PowerShell](Deploy-Software-Defined-Network-Technologies-using-Windows-PowerShell.md).
