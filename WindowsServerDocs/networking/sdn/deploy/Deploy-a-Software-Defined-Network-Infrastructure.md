# Deploy a Software Defined Network infrastructure

Deploy Microsoft's Software Defined Networking (SDN) infrastructure.

These deployments include all the technologies you need for a fully functional infrastructure, including Hyper-V Network Virtualization (HNV), network controllers, software load balancers (SLB/MUX), and gateways.

## Set up SDN infrastructure in the VMM fabric




-   [Set up a Software Defined Network (SDN) infrastructure in the VMM fabric](/system-center/vmm/deploy-sdn)

    Use this method if you want to incorporate System Center Virtual Machine Manger (VMM) to manage your SDN infrastructure.

## Deploy SDN infrastructure using scripts

-   [Deploy a Software Defined Network infrastructure using scripts](../../sdn/deploy/Deploy-a-Software-Defined-Network-infrastructure-using-scripts.md)

    Use this method if you do not want to use VMM to manage your SDN infrastructure, or if you have another management method.


## Deploy individual SDN technologies instead of an entire infrastructure
 If you want to deploy individual SDN technologies instead of an entire infrastructure, see:
[Deploy Software Defined Network Technologies using Windows PowerShell](Deploy-Software-Defined-Network-Technologies-using-Windows-PowerShell.md).
