# Switch Embedded Teaming for SDN

>Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2; Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

Switch Embedded Teaming (SET) is an alternative NIC Teaming solution that you can use in environments that include Hyper-V and the Software Defined Networking (SDN) stack in Windows Server 2019 and 2016. SET integrates some NIC Teaming functionality into the Hyper-V Virtual Switch.

SET allows you to group between one and eight physical Ethernet network adapters into one or more software-based virtual network adapters. These virtual network adapters provide fast performance and fault tolerance in the event of a network adapter failure.

For more information, see [Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) and Switch Embedded Teaming (SET)](../../../virtualization//hyper-v-virtual-switch/RDMA-and-Switch-Embedded-Teaming.md).
