# Install the Network Controller Server Role Using Server Manager

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2; Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

This topic provides instructions on how to install the Network Controller server role by using Server Manager.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not deploy the Network Controller server role on physical hosts. To deploy Network Controller, you must install the Network Controller server role on a Hyper-V virtual machine \(VM\) that is installed on a Hyper-V host. After you have installed Network Controller on VMs on three different Hyper\-V hosts, you must enable the Hyper\-V hosts for Software Defined Networking \(SDN\) by adding the hosts to Network Controller using the Windows PowerShell command **New-NetworkControllerServer**. By doing so, you are enabling the SDN Software Load Balancer to function. For more information, see [New-NetworkControllerServer](/powershell/module/networkcontroller/new-networkcontrollerserver).

After you install Network Controller, you must use Windows PowerShell commands for additional Network Controller configuration. For more information, see [Deploy Network Controller using Windows PowerShell](../../deploy/Deploy-Network-Controller-using-Windows-PowerShell.md).

### To install Network Controller

1. In Server Manager, click **Manage**, and then click **Add Roles and Features**. The Add Roles and Features wizard opens. Click **Next**.

2. In **Select Installation Type**, keep the default setting and click **Next**.

3. In **Select Destination Server**, choose the server where you want to install Network Controller, and then click **Next**.

4. In **Select Server Roles**, in **Roles**, click **Network Controller**.
