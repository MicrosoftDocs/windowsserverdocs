# Plan a Software Defined Network Infrastructure

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

Learn about deployment planning for a Software Defined Network infrastructure, including the hardware and software prerequisites. 


## Prerequisites
This topic describes a number of hardware and software prerequisites, including:

-   **Configured security groups, log file locations, and dynamic DNS registration** You must prepare your datacenter for Network Controller deployment, which requires one or more computers or VMs and one computer or VM. Before you can deploy Network Controller, you must configure the security groups, log file locations (if needed), and dynamic DNS registration.  If you have not prepared your datacenter for Network Controller deployment, see [Installation and Preparation Requirements for Deploying Network Controller](Installation-and-Preparation-Requirements-for-Deploying-Network-Controller.md) for details.

-   **Physical network**  You need access to your physical network devices to configure VLANs, Routing, BGP, Data Center Bridging (ETS) if using an RDMA technology, and Data Center Bridging (PFC) if using a RoCE based RDMA technology. This topic shows manual switch configuration as well as BGP Peering on Layer-3 switches / routers or a Routing and Remote Access Server (RRAS) virtual machine.   

-   **Physical compute hosts**  These hosts run Hyper-V and are required to host SDN infrastructure and tenant virtual machines.  Specific network hardware is required in these hosts for best performance, which is described later in the **Network hardware** section.  


## Physical network and compute host configuration

Each physical compute host requires network connectivity through one or more network adapters attached to a physical switch port(s).  A Layer-2 [VLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN) supports networks divided into multiple logical network segments. 

>[!TIP]
>Use VLAN 0 for logical networks in access mode or untagged. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Windows Server 2016 Software Defined Networking supports IPv4 addressing for the underlay and the overlay. IPv6 is not supported.

### Logical networks

#### Management and HNV Provider 

All physical compute hosts must access the Management logical network and the HNV Provider logical network.  For IP address planning purposes, each physical compute host must have at least one IP address assigned from the Management logical network. The network controller requires a reserved IP address to serve as the REST IP address. 

A DHCP server can automatically assign IP addresses for the Management network, or you can manually assign static IP address. The SDN stack automatically assigns IP addresses for the HNV Provider logical network for the individual Hyper-V hosts from an IP Pool specified through and managed by the Network Controller. 

>[!NOTE]
>The Network Controller assigns an HNV Provider IP address to a physical compute host only after the Network Controller Host Agent receives network policy for a specific tenant virtual machine.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                  The logical networks use VLANs,                                                  |                                                                 the physical compute host must connect to a trunked switch port that has access to these VLANs. It's important to note that the physical network adapters on the computer host must not have any VLAN filtering activated.                                                                 |
|                Using Switched-Embedded Teaming (SET) and have multiple NIC team members, such as network adapters,                |                                                                                                                        you must connect all of the NIC team members for that particular host to the same Layer-2 broadcast domain.                                                                                                                         |
| The physical compute host is running additional infrastructure virtual machines, such as Network Controller, SLB/MUX, or Gateway, | that host must have an additional IP address assigned from the Management logical network for each of the virtual machines hosted.<p>Also, each SLB/MUX infrastructure virtual machine must have an IP address reserved for the HNV Provider logical network. Failure to have an IP address reserved may result in duplicate IP addresses on your network. |

For information about Hyper-V Network Virtualization (HNV), which you can use to virtualize networks in a Microsoft SDN deployment, see [Hyper-V Network Virtualization](../technologies/hyper-v-network-virtualization/Hyper-V-Network-Virtualization.md).  



#### Gateways and the Software Load Balancer

Additional logical networks need to be created and provisioned for gateway and SLB usage. Make sure to obtain the correct IP prefixes, VLAN IDs, and gateway IP addresses for these networks.

|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   **Transit logical network**   | The RAS Gateway and SLB/MUX use the Transit logical network to exchange BGP peering information and North/South (external-internal) tenant traffic. The size of this subnet will typically be smaller than the others. Only physical compute hosts that run RAS Gateway or SLB/MUX virtual machines need to have connectivity to this subnet with these VLANs trunked and accessible on the switch ports to which the compute hosts' network adapters are connected. Each SLB/MUX or RAS Gateway virtual machine is statically assigned one IP address from the Transit logical network. |
| **Public VIP logical network**  |                                                                                                                             The Public VIP logical network is required to have IP subnet prefixes that are routable outside of the cloud environment (typically Internet routable).  These will be the front-end IP addresses used by external clients to access resources in the virtual networks including the front end VIP for the Site-to-site gateway.                                                                                                                             |
| **Private VIP logical network** |                                                                                                                                                                                       The Private VIP logical network is not required to be routable outside of the cloud as it is used for VIPs that are only accessed from internal cloud clients, such as the SLB Mananger or private services.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|   **GRE VIP logical network**   |                                                                                                                                           The GRE VIP network is a subnet that exists solely for defining VIPs that are assigned to gateway virtual machines running on your SDN fabric for a S2S GRE connection type. This network does not need to be pre-configured in your physical switches or router and need not have a VLAN assigned.                                                                                                                                            |

### Logical networks required for RDMA-based storage  

If using RDMA-based storage, define a VLAN and subnet for each physical adapter (two adapters per node) in your compute and storage hosts.  

>[!IMPORTANT]
>For Quality of Service (QoS) to be appropriately applied, physical switches require a tagged VLAN for RDMA traffic.

## Routing infrastructure  

If you are deploying your SDN infrastructure using scripts, the Management, HNV Provider, Transit, and VIP subnets must be routable to each other on the physical network.     

Routing information \(e.g. next-hop\) for the VIP subnets is advertised by the SLB/MUX and RAS Gateways into the physical network using internal BGP peering. The VIP logical networks do not have a VLAN assigned and is not pre-configured in the Layer-2 switch (e.g. Top-of-Rack switch).  

You need to create a BGP peer on the router that is used by your SDN infrastructure to receive routes for the VIP logical networks advertised by the SLB/MUXes and RAS Gateways. BGP peering only needs to occur one way (from SLB/MUX or RAS Gateway to external BGP peer).  Above the first layer of routing you can use static routes or another dynamic routing protocol such as OSPF, however, as previously stated, the IP subnet prefix for the VIP logical networks do need to be routable from the physical network to the external BGP peer.   

BGP peering is typically configured in a managed switch or router as part of the network infrastructure. The BGP peer could also be configured on a Windows Server with the Remote Access Server (RAS) role installed in a Routing Only mode. This BGP router peer in the network infrastructure must be configured to have its own ASN and allow peering from an ASN that is assigned to the SDN components \(SLB/MUX and RAS Gateways\). You must obtain the following information from your physical router, or from the network administrator in control of that router:

- Router ASN  
- Router IP address  
- ASN for use by SDN components (can be any AS number from the private ASN range)

>[!NOTE]
>Four byte ASNs are not supported by the SLB/MUX. You must allocate two byte ASNs to the SLB/MUX and the router wo which it connects. You can use 4 byte ASNs elsewhere in your environment.  

You or your network administrator must configure the BGP router peer to accept connections from the ASN and IP address or subnet address of the Transit logical network that your RAS gateway and SLB/MUXes are using.

For more information, see [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](../../../remote/remote-access/bgp/Border-Gateway-Protocol-BGP.md).

## Default gateways
Machines that are configured to connect to multiple networks, such as the physical hosts and gateway virtual machines must only have one default gateway configured. Configure the default gateway on the adapter used to reach the Internet.

For virtual machines, follow these rules to decide which network to use as the default gateway:

1. Use the Transit logical network as the default gateway if a virtual machine connects to the Transit network, or if it is multi-homed to the Transit network or any other network.
2. Use the Management network as the default gateway if a virtual machine only connects to the Management network. 
3. Use the HNV Provider network for SLB/MUXes and RAS Gateways. Do not use the HNV Provider network as a default gateway. 
4. Do not connect virtual machines directly to the Storage1, Storage2, Public VIP or Private VIP networks.

For Hyper-V hosts and storage nodes, use the Management network as the default gateway.  The storage networks must never have a default gateway assigned.


## Network hardware

You can use the following sections to plan network hardware deployment.

### Network Interface Cards (NICs)

The network interface cards (NICs) used in your Hyper-V hosts and storage hosts require specific capabilities to achieve the best performance. 

Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is a kernel bypass technique that makes it possible to transfer large amounts of data without using the host CPU, which frees the CPU to perform other work. 

Switch Embedded Teaming (SET) is an alternative NIC Teaming solution that you can use in environments that include Hyper-V and the Software Defined Networking (SDN) stack in Windows Server 2016. SET integrates some NIC Teaming functionality into the Hyper-V Virtual Switch. 

For more information, see [Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) and Switch Embedded Teaming (SET)](../../../virtualization//hyper-v-virtual-switch/RDMA-and-Switch-Embedded-Teaming.md).   

To account for the overhead in tenant virtual network traffic caused by VXLAN or NVGRE encapsulation headers, the MTU of the Layer-2 fabric network (switches and hosts) must be set to greater than or equal to 1674 Bytes \(including Layer-2 Ethernet headers\). 

NICs that support the new *EncapOverhead* advanced adapter keyword sets the MTU  automatically through the network controller Host Agent. NICs that do not support the new *EncapOverhead* keyword need to set the MTU size manually on each physical host using the *JumboPacket* \(or equivalent\) keyword. 


### Switches

When selecting a physical switch and router for your environment, make sure it supports the following set of capabilities:  

- Switchport MTU settings \(required\)  
- MTU set to >= 1674 Bytes \(including L2-Ethernet Header\)  
- L3 protocols \(required\)  
- ECMP  
- BGP \(IETF RFC 4271\)\-based ECMP

Implementations should support the MUST statements in the following IETF standards.

- RFC 2545: "BGP-4 Multiprotocol extensions for IPv6 Inter-Domain Routing"  
- RFC 4760: "Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"  
- RFC 4893: "BGP Support for Four-octet AS Number Space"  
- RFC 4456: "BGP Route Reflection: An Alternative to Full Mesh Internal BGP (IBGP)"  
- RFC 4724: "Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP"  

The following tagging protocols are required.

- VLAN - Isolation of various types of traffic
- 802.1q trunk

The following items provide Link control.

- Quality of service \(PFC only required if using RoCE\)
- Enhanced Traffic Selection \(802.1Qaz\)
- Priority Based Flow Control \(802.1p/Q and 802.1Qbb\)

The following items provide availability and redundancy.

- Switch availability (required)
- A highly available router is required to perform gateway functions. You can do this by using a multi-chassis switch\ router or technologies like VRRP.

The following items provide management capabilities.

**Monitoring**

- SNMP v1 or SNMP v2 (required if using Network Controller for physical switch monitoring)  
- SNMP MIBs \(required if you are using Network Controller for physical switch monitoring\)  
- MIB-II (RFC 1213), LLDP, Interface MIB \(RFC 2863\), IF-MIB, IP-MIB, IP-FORWARD-MIB, Q-BRIDGE-MIB, BRIDGE-MIB, LLDB-MIB, Entity-MIB, IEEE8023-LAG-MIB  

The following diagrams show a sample four-node setup. For clarity purposes, the first diagram shows just the network controller, the second shows the network controller plus the software load balancer, and the third diagram shows the network controller, software load balancer, and the gateway.  

These diagrams do not show storage networks and vNICs. If you plan to use SMB-based storage, these are required.

Both the infrastructure and tenant virtual machines can be redistributed across any physical compute host (assuming the correct network connectivity exists for the correct logical networks).  



## Switch configuration examples  

To help configure your physical switch or router, a set of sample configuration files for a variety of switch models and vendors are available at the [Microsoft SDN Github repository](https://github.com/microsoft/SDN/tree/master/SwitchConfigExamples). A detailed readme and tested command line interface (CLI) commands for specific switches are provided.         


## Compute  
All Hyper-V hosts must have Windows Server 2016 installed, Hyper-V enabled, and an external Hyper-V virtual switch created with at least one physical adapter connected to the Management logical network. The host must be reachable via a Management IP address assigned to the Management Host vNIC.  

Any storage type that is compatible with Hyper-V, shared or local may be used.   

> [!TIP]  
> It is convenient if you use the same name for all your virtual switches, but it is not mandatory. If you plan to deploy with scripts, see the comment associated with the `vSwitchName` variable in the config.psd1 file.  

**Host compute requirements**  
The following table shows the minimum hardware and software requirements for the four physical hosts used in the example deployment.  

Host|Hardware Requirements|Software Requirements|

If you use VMM for deployment, additional infrastructure virtual machine resources are required for VMM and other non-SDN infrastructure. For additional information, see [Minimum Hardware Recommendations for System Center Technical Preview.](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn997303.aspx)  

## Extending your infrastructure  
The sizing and resource requirements for your infrastructure are dependent on the tenant workload virtual machines that you plan to host. The CPU, memory, and disk requirements for the infrastructure virtual machines (for example: network controller, SLB, gateway, etc.) are listed in the previous table. You can add more of these infrastructure virtual machines to scale out as needed. However, any tenant virtual machines running on the Hyper-V hosts have their own CPU, memory, and disk requirements that you must consider.   

When the tenant workload virtual machines begin to consume too many resources on the physical Hyper-V hosts, you can extend your infrastructure by adding additional physical hosts. This can be done with Virtual Machine Manager or by using PowerShell scripts (depending on how you initially deployed the infrastructure) to create new server resources through the network controller. If you need to add additional IP addresses for the HNV Provider network, you can create new logical subnets (with corresponding IP Pools) that the hosts can use.
