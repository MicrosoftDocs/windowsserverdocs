# Performance Tuning Guidelines for Windows Server 2022

When you run a server system in your organization, you might have business needs not met using default server settings. For example, you might need the lowest possible energy consumption, or the lowest possible latency, or the maximum possible throughput on your server. This guide provides a set of guidelines that you can use to tune the server settings in Windows Server 2022 and obtain incremental performance or energy efficiency gains, especially when the nature of the workload varies little over time.

It is important that your tuning changes consider the hardware, the workload, the power budgets, and the performance goals of your server. This guide describes each setting and its potential effect to help you make an informed decision about its relevance to your system, workload, performance, and energy usage goals.

> [!warning]
> Registry settings and tuning parameters changed significantly between versions of Windows Server. Be sure to use the latest tuning guidelines to avoid unexpected results.

## In this guide
This guide organizes performance and tuning guidance for Windows Server 2022 across three tuning categories:

|Server Hardware | Server Role | Server Subsystem |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|[Hardware performance considerations](hardware/index.md) |[Active Directory Servers](role/active-directory-server/index.md) |[Cache and memory management](subsystem/cache-memory-management/index.md)|
|[Hardware power considerations](hardware/power.md)|[File Servers](role/file-server/index.md)|[Networking subsystem](../../networking/technologies/network-subsystem/net-sub-performance-top.md)|
||[Hyper-V Servers](role/hyper-v-server/index.md)|[Storage Spaces Direct](subsystem/storage-spaces-direct/index.md)|
||[Remote Desktop Services](role/remote-desktop/session-hosts.md)|[Software Defined Networking (SDN)](subsystem/software-defined-networking/index.md)|
||[Web Servers](role/web-server/index.md)||
||[Windows Server Containers](role/windows-server-container/index.md)||
