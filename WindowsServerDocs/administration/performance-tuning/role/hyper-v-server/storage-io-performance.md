# Hyper-V Storage I/O Performance

This section describes the different options and considerations for tuning storage I/O performance in a virtual machine. The storage I/O path extends from the guest storage stack, through the host virtualization layer, to the host storage stack, and then to the physical disk. Following are explanations about how optimizations are possible at each of these stages.

## Virtual controllers

Hyper-V offers three types of virtual controllers: IDE, SCSI, and Virtual host bus adapters (HBAs).

## IDE

IDE controllers expose IDE disks to the virtual machine. The IDE controller is emulated, and it is the only controller that is available for guest VMs running older version of Windows without the Virtual Machine Integration Services. Disk I/O that is performed by using the IDE filter driver that is provided with the Virtual Machine Integration Services is significantly better than the disk I/O performance that is provided with the emulated IDE controller. We recommend that IDE disks be used only for the operating system disks because they have performance limitations due to the maximum I/O size that can be issued to these devices.

## SCSI (SAS controller)

SCSI controllers expose SCSI disks to the virtual machine, and each virtual SCSI controller can support up to 64 devices. For optimal performance, we recommend that you attach multiple disks to a single virtual SCSI controller and create additional controllers only as they are required to scale the number of disks connected to the virtual machine. SCSI path is not emulated which makes it the preferred controller for any disk other than the operating system disk. In fact with Generation 2 VMs, it is the only type of controller possible. Introduced in Windows Server 2012 R2, this controller is reported as SAS to support shared VHDX.

## Virtual Fibre Channel HBAs

Virtual Fibre Channel HBAs can be configured to allow direct access for virtual machines to Fibre Channel and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) LUNs. Virtual Fibre Channel disks bypass the NTFS file system in the root partition, which reduces the CPU usage of storage I/O.

Large data drives and drives that are shared between multiple virtual machines (for guest clustering scenarios) are prime candidates for virtual Fibre Channel disks.

Virtual Fibre Channel disks require one or more Fibre Channel host bus adapters (HBAs) to be installed on the host. Each host HBA is required to use an HBA driver that supports the Windows Server 2016 Virtual Fibre Channel/NPIV capabilities. The SAN fabric should support NPIV, and the HBA port(s) that are used for the virtual Fibre Channel should be set up in a Fibre Channel topology that supports NPIV.

To maximize throughput on hosts that are installed with more than one HBA, we recommend that you configure multiple virtual HBAs inside the Hyper-V virtual machine (up to four HBAs can be configured for each virtual machine). Hyper-V will automatically make a best effort to balance virtual HBAs to host HBAs that access the same virtual SAN.

## Virtual disks

Disks can be exposed to the virtual machines through the virtual controllers. These disks could be virtual hard disks that are file abstractions of a disk or a pass-through disk on the host.

## Virtual hard disks

There are two virtual hard disk formats, VHD and VHDX. Each of these formats supports three types of virtual hard disk files.

## VHD format

The VHD format was the only virtual hard disk format that was supported by Hyper-V in past releases. Introduced in Windows Server 2012, the VHD format has been modified to allow better alignment, which results in significantly better performance on new large sector disks.

Any new VHD that is created on a Windows Server 2012 or newer has the optimal 4 KB alignment. This aligned format is completely compatible with previous Windows Server operating systems. However, the alignment property will be broken for new allocations from parsers that are not 4 KB alignment-aware (such as a VHD parser from a previous version of Windows Server or a non-Microsoft parser).

Any VHD that is moved from a previous release does not automatically get converted to this new improved VHD format.

To convert to new VHD format, run the following Windows PowerShell command:

``` syntax
Convert-VHD –Path E:\vms\testvhd\test.vhd –DestinationPath E:\vms\testvhd\test-converted.vhd
```

You can check the alignment property for all the VHDs on the system, and it should be converted to the optimal 4 KB alignment. You create a new VHD with the data from the original VHD by using the **Create-from-Source** option.

To check for alignment by using Windows Powershell, examine the Alignment line, as shown below:

``` syntax
Get-VHD –Path E:\vms\testvhd\test.vhd

Path                    : E:\vms\testvhd\test.vhd
VhdFormat               : VHD
VhdType                 : Dynamic
FileSize                : 69245440
Size                    : 10737418240
MinimumSize             : 10735321088
LogicalSectorSize       : 512
PhysicalSectorSize      : 512
BlockSize               : 2097152
ParentPath              :
FragmentationPercentage : 10
Alignment               : 0
Attached                : False
DiskNumber              :
IsDeleted               : False
Number                  :
```

To verify alignment by using Windows PowerShell, examine the Alignment line, as shown below:

``` syntax
Get-VHD –Path E:\vms\testvhd\test-converted.vhd

Path                    : E:\vms\testvhd\test-converted.vhd
VhdFormat               : VHD
VhdType                 : Dynamic
FileSize                : 69369856
Size                    : 10737418240
MinimumSize             : 10735321088
LogicalSectorSize       : 512
PhysicalSectorSize      : 512
BlockSize               : 2097152
ParentPath              :
FragmentationPercentage : 0
Alignment               : 1
Attached                : False
DiskNumber              :
IsDeleted               : False
Number                  :
```

## VHDX format

VHDX is a new virtual hard disk format introduced in Windows Server 2012, which allows you to create resilient high-performance virtual disks up to 64 terabytes. Benefits of this format include:

-   Support for virtual hard disk storage capacity of up to 64 terabytes.

-   Protection against data corruption during power failures by logging updates to the VHDX metadata structures.

-   Ability to store custom metadata about a file, which a user might want to record, such as operating system version or patches applied.

The VHDX format also provides the following performance benefits:

-   Improved alignment of the virtual hard disk format to work well on large sector disks.

-   Larger block sizes for dynamic and differential disks, which allows these disks to attune to the needs of the workload.

-   4 KB logical sector virtual disk that allows for increased performance when used by applications and workloads that are designed for 4 KB sectors.

-   Efficiency in representing data, which results in smaller file size and allows the underlying physical storage device to reclaim unused space. (Trim requires pass-through or SCSI disks and trim-compatible hardware.)

When you upgrade to Windows Server 2016, we recommend that you convert all VHD files to the VHDX format due to these benefits. The only scenario where it would make sense to keep the files in the VHD format is when a virtual machine has the potential to be moved to a previous release of Hyper-V that does not support the VHDX format.

## Types of virtual hard disk files

There are three types of VHD files. The following sections are the performance characteristics and trade-offs between the types.

The following recommendations should be taken into consideration with regards to selecting a VHD file type:

-   When using the VHD format, we recommend that you use the fixed type because it has better resiliency and performance characteristics compared to the other VHD file types.

-   When using the VHDX format, we recommend that you use the dynamic type because it offers resiliency guarantees in addition to space savings that are associated with allocating space only when there is a need to do so.

-   The fixed type is also recommended, irrespective of the format, when the storage on the hosting volume is not actively monitored to ensure that sufficient disk space is present when expanding the VHD file at run time.

-   Snapshots of a virtual machine create a differencing VHD to store writes to the disks. Having only a few snapshots can elevate the CPU usage of storage I/Os, but might not noticeably affect performance except in highly I/O-intensive server workloads. However, having a large chain of snapshots can noticeably affect performance because reading from the VHD can require checking for the requested blocks in many differencing VHDs. Keeping snapshot chains short is important for maintaining good disk I/O performance.

## Fixed virtual hard disk type

Space for the VHD is first allocated when the VHD file is created. This type of VHD file is less likely to fragment, which reduces the I/O throughput when a single I/O is split into multiple I/Os. It has the lowest CPU overhead of the three VHD file types because reads and writes do not need to look up the mapping of the block.

## Dynamic virtual hard disk type

Space for the VHD is allocated on demand. The blocks in the disk start as unallocated blocks and are not backed by any actual space in the file. When a block is first written to, the virtualization stack must allocate space within the VHD file for the block, and then update the metadata. This increases the number of necessary disk I/Os for the Write and increases CPU usage. Reads and writes to existing blocks incur disk access and CPU overhead when looking up the blocks' mapping in the metadata.

## Differencing virtual hard disk type

The VHD points to a parent VHD file. Any writes to blocks not written to result in space being allocated in the VHD file, as with a dynamically expanding VHD. Reads are serviced from the VHD file if the block has been written to. Otherwise, they are serviced from the parent VHD file. In both cases, the metadata is read to determine the mapping of the block. Reads and Writes to this VHD can consume more CPU and result in more I/Os than a fixed VHD file.

## Block size considerations

Block size can significantly impact performance. It is optimal to match the block size to the allocation patterns of the workload that is using the disk. For example, if an application is allocating in chunks of 16 MB, it would be optimal to have a virtual hard disk block size of 16 MB. A block size of &gt;2 MB is possible only on virtual hard disks with the VHDX format. Having a larger block size than the allocation pattern for a random I/O workload will significantly increase the space usage on the host.

## Sector size implications

Most of the software industry has depended on disk sectors of 512 bytes, but the standard is moving to 4 KB disk sectors. To reduce compatibility issues that might arise from a change in sector size, hard drive vendors are introducing a transitional size referred to as 512 emulation drives (512e).

These emulation drives offer some of the advantages that are offered by 4 KB disk sector native drives, such as improved format efficiency and an improved scheme for error correction codes (ECC). They come with fewer compatibility issues that would occur by exposing a 4 KB sector size at the disk interface.

## Support for 512e disks

A 512e disk can perform a write only in terms of a physical sector—that is, it cannot directly write a 512byte sector that is issued to it. The internal process in the disk that makes these writes possible follows these steps:

-   The disk reads the 4 KB physical sector to its internal cache, which contains the 512-byte logical sector referred to in the write.

-   Data in the 4 KB buffer is modified to include the updated 512-byte sector.

-   The disk performs a write of the updated 4 KB buffer back to its physical sector on the disk.

This process is called read-modify-write (RMW). The overall performance impact of the RMW process depends on the workloads. The RMW process causes performance degradation in virtual hard disks for the following reasons:

-   Dynamic and differencing virtual hard disks have a 512-byte sector bitmap in front of their data payload. In addition, footer, header, and parent locators align to a 512-byte sector. It is common for the virtual hard disk driver to issue 512-byte write commands to update these structures, resulting in the RMW process described earlier.

-   Applications commonly issue reads and writes in multiples of 4 KB sizes (the default cluster size of NTFS). Because there is a 512-byte sector bitmap in front of the data payload block of dynamic and differencing virtual hard disks, the 4 KB blocks are not aligned to the physical 4 KB boundary. The following figure shows a VHD 4 KB block (highlighted) that is not aligned with physical 4 KB boundary.

![vhd 4 kb block](../../media/perftune-guide-vhd-4kb-block.png)

Each 4 KB write command that is issued by the current parser to update the payload data results in two reads for two blocks on the disk, which are then updated and subsequently written back to the two disk blocks. Hyper-V in Windows Server 2016 mitigates some of the performance effects on 512e disks on the VHD stack by preparing the previously mentioned structures for alignment to 4 KB boundaries in the VHD format. This avoids the RMW effect when accessing the data within the virtual hard disk file and when updating the virtual hard disk metadata structures.

As mentioned earlier, VHDs that are copied from previous versions of Windows Server will not automatically be aligned to 4 KB. You can manually convert them to optimally align by using the **Copy from Source** disk option that is available in the VHD interfaces.

By default, VHDs are exposed with a physical sector size of 512 bytes. This is done to ensure that physical sector size dependent applications are not impacted when the application and VHDs are moved from a previous version of Windows Server.

By default, disks with the VHDX format are created with the 4 KB physical sector size to optimize their performance profile regular disks and large sector disks. To make full use of 4 KB sectors it's recommended to use VHDX format.

## Support for native 4 KB disks

Hyper-V in Windows Server 2012 R2 and beyond supports 4 KB native disks. But it is still possible to store VHD disk on 4 KB native disk. This is done by implementing a software RMW algorithm in the virtual storage stack layer that converts 512-byte access and update requests to corresponding 4 KB accesses and updates.

Because VHD file can only expose themselves as 512-byte logical sector size disks, it is very likely that there will be applications that issue 512-byte I/O requests. In these cases, the RMW layer will satisfy these requests and cause performance degradation. This is also true for a disk that is formatted with VHDX that has a logical sector size of 512 bytes.

It is possible to configure a VHDX file to be exposed as a 4 KB logical sector size disk, and this would be an optimal configuration for performance when the disk is hosted on a 4 KB native physical device. Care should be taken to ensure that the guest and the application that is using the virtual disk are backed by the 4 KB logical sector size. The VHDX formatting will work correctly on a 4 KB logical sector size device.

## Pass-through disks

The VHD in a virtual machine can be mapped directly to a physical disk or logical unit number (LUN), instead of to a VHD file. The benefit is that this configuration bypasses the NTFS file system in the root partition, which reduces the CPU usage of storage I/O. The risk is that physical disks or LUNs can be more difficult to move between machines than VHD files.

Pass-through disks should be avoided due to the limitations introduced with virtual machine migration scenarios.

## Advanced storage features

### Storage Quality of Service (QoS)

Starting in Windows Server 2012 R2, Hyper-V includes the ability to set certain quality-of-service (QoS) parameters for storage on the virtual machines. Storage QoS provides storage performance isolation in a multitenant environment and mechanisms to notify you when the storage I/O performance does not meet the defined threshold to efficiently run your virtual machine workloads.

Storage QoS provides the ability to specify a maximum input/output operations per second (IOPS) value for your virtual hard disk. An administrator can throttle the storage I/O to stop a tenant from consuming excessive storage resources that may impact another tenant.

You can also set a minimum IOPS value. They will be notified when the IOPS to a specified virtual hard disk is below a threshold that is needed for its optimal performance.

The virtual machine metrics infrastructure is also updated, with storage related parameters to allow the administrator to monitor the performance and chargeback related parameters.

Maximum and minimum values are specified in terms of normalized IOPS where every 8 KB of data is counted as an I/O.

Some of the limitations are as follows:

-   Only for virtual disks

-   Differencing disk cannot have parent virtual disk on a different volume

-   Replica - QoS for replica site configured separately from primary site

-   Shared VHDX is not supported

For more info on Storage Quality of Service, see [Storage Quality of Service for Hyper-V](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn282281(v=ws.11)).

### NUMA I/O

Windows Server 2012 and beyond supports large virtual machines, and any large virtual machine configuration (for example, a configuration with Microsoft SQL Server running with 64 virtual processors) will also need scalability in terms of I/O throughput.

The following key improvements first introduced in the Windows Server 2012 storage stack and Hyper-V provide the I/O scalability needs of large virtual machines:

-   An increase in the number of communication channels created between the guest devices and host storage stack.

-   A more efficient I/O completion mechanism involving interrupt distribution amongst the virtual processors to avoid expensive interprocessor interruptions.

Introduced in Windows Server 2012, there are a few registry entries, located at HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Enum\\VMBUS\\{device id}\\{instance id}\\StorChannel, that allow the number of channels to be adjusted. They also align the virtual processors that handle the I/O completions to the virtual CPUs that are assigned by the application to be the I/O processors. The registry settings are configured on a per-adapter basis on the device's hardware key.

-   **ChannelCount (DWORD)** The total number of channels to use, with a maximum of 16. It defaults to a ceiling, which is the number of virtual processors/16.

-   **ChannelMask (QWORD)** The processor affinity for the channels. If it is not set or is set to 0, it defaults to the existing channel distribution algorithm that you use for normal storage or for networking channels. This ensures that your storage channels won't conflict with your network channels.

### Offloaded Data Transfer integration

Crucial maintenance tasks for VHDs, such as merge, move, and compact, depend copying large amounts of data. The current method of copying data requires data to be read in and written to different locations, which can be a time-consuming process. It also uses CPU and memory resources on the host, which could have been used to service virtual machines.

Storage area network (SAN) vendors are working to provide near-instantaneous copy operations of large amounts of data. This storage is designed to allow the system above the disks to specify the move of a specific data set from one location to another. This hardware feature is known as an Offloaded Data Transfer.

Hyper-V in Windows Server 2012 and beyond supports Offload Data Transfer (ODX) operations so that these operations can be passed from the guest operating system to the host hardware. This ensures that the workload can use ODX-enabled storage as it would if it were running in a non-virtualized environment. The Hyper-V storage stack also issues ODX operations during maintenance operations for VHDs such as merging disks and storage migration meta-operations where large amounts of data are moved.

### Unmap integration

Virtual hard disk files exist as files on a storage volume, and they share available space with other files. Because the size of these files tends to be large, the space that they consume can grow quickly. Demand for more physical storage affects the IT hardware budget. It's important to optimize the use of physical storage as much as possible.

Before Windows Server 2012, when applications delete content within a virtual hard disk, which effectively abandoned the content's storage space, the Windows storage stack in the guest operating system and the Hyper-V host had limitations that prevented this information from being communicated to the virtual hard disk and the physical storage device. This prevented the Hyper-V storage stack from optimizing the space usage by the VHD-based virtual disk files. It also prevented the underlying storage device from reclaiming the space that was previously occupied by the deleted data.

Starting from Windows Server 2012, Hyper-V supports unmap notifications, which allow VHDX files to be more efficient in representing that data within it. This results in smaller files size, and it allows the underlying physical storage device to reclaim unused space.

Only Hyper-V-specific SCSI, enlightened IDE, and Virtual Fibre Channel controllers allow the unmap command from the guest to reach the host virtual storage stack. On the virtual hard disks, only virtual disks formatted as VHDX support unmap commands from the guest.

For these reasons, we recommend that you use VHDX files attached to a SCSI controller when not using Virtual Fibre Channel disks.
