# Performance Tuning for Powershell

This document discusses general guidelines for achieving the best possible performance of PowerShell 5.1. Some of the issues described in this document may be addressed in future versions.

This document does not describe best practices.

The guidance in this document should be applied in a thoughtful manner.
* Performance is often not an issue, saving 10ms or 100ms might go completely unnoticed.
* Some guidance in this document describes atypical PowerShell usage that may be confusing and unfamiliar to some PowerShell users.

The following topics provide specific guidance.

-   [Script Authoring Considerations](script-authoring-considerations.md)

-   [Module Authoring Considerations](module-authoring-considerations.md)
