# Step 4: Configure Group Policy Settings for Automatic Updates

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

In an active directory environment, you can use Group Policy to define how computers and users (referred to in this document as WSUS clients) can interact with Windows Updates to obtain automatic updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).

This topic contains two main sections:

[Group Policy settings for WSUS client updates](#group-policy-settings-for-wsus-client-updates), which provides prescriptive guidance and behavioral details about the Windows Update and Maintenance Scheduler settings of Group Policy that control how WSUS clients can interact with Windows Update to obtain automatic updates.

[Supplemental information](#supplemental-information) has the following sections:

-   [Accessing the Windows Update settings in Group Policy](#accessing-the-windows-update-settings-in-group-policy), which provides general guidance about using Group Policy Management editor, and information about accessing the Update Services policy extensions and Maintenance Scheduler settings in Group Policy.

-   [Changes to WSUS relevant to this guide](#changes-to-wsus-relevant-to-this-guide): for administrators familiar with WSUS 3.2 and previous versions, this section gives a brief summary of key differences between the current and past version of WSUS relevant to this guide.

-   [Terms and Definitions](#terms-and-definitions): definitions for various terms pertaining to WSUS and update services that are used in this guide.

## Group Policy settings for WSUS client updates
This section provides information about three extensions of Group Policy. In these extensions you will find the settings that you can use to configure how WSUS clients can interact with Windows Update to receive automatic updates.

|**Not Configured**|Specifies that the use of automatic updates is not specified at the Group Policy level. However, a computer administrator can still configure automatic updates in the Control Panel.|
|**Enabled**|Specifies that Windows recognizes when the computer is online and uses its Internet connection to search Windows Update for available updates.<br /><br />When enabled, local administrators will be allowed to use the Windows Update control panel to select a configuration option of their choice. However, local administrators will not be allowed to disable the configuration for Automatic Updates.<br /><br />-   **2 - Notify for download and notify for install**<br />    When Windows Update finds updates that apply to the computer, users will be notified that updates are ready for download. Users can then run Windows Update to download and install any available updates.<br />-   **3 - Auto download and notify for install** (default setting)<br />    Windows Update finds applicable updates and downloads them in the background; the user is not notified or interrupted during the process. When the downloads are complete, users are notified that there are updates ready to install. Users can then run Windows Update to install the downloaded updates.<br />-   **4 - Auto download and schedule the install**<br />    You can specify the schedule by using the options in this Group Policy setting. If no schedule is specified, the default schedule for all installations will be every day at 3:00 A.M. If any updates require a restart to complete the installation, Windows will restart the computer automatically. (if a user is signed in to the computer when Windows is ready to restart, the user will be notified and given the option to delay the restart.) **Note:**     starting Windows 8, you can set updates to install during automatic maintenance instead of using a specific schedule tied to Windows Update. Automatic maintenance will install updates when the computer is not in use, and avoid installing updates when the computer is running on battery power. If automatic maintenance is unable to install updates within days, Windows Update will install updates right away. Users will then be notified about a pending restart. A pending restart will only take place if there is no potential for accidental data loss.    You can specify schedule options in the GPME Maintenance Scheduler settings, which are located in the path, *PolicyName* > **computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows components** > **Maintenance Scheduler** > **Automatic Maintenance Activation Boundary**. See the section of this reference titled: [Maintenance Scheduler settings](#computer-configuration--maintenance-scheduler-policy-settings), for setting details.    **5 - Allow local admin to choose setting**<br />-   Specifies whether local administrators are allowed to use the Automatic Updates control panel to select a configuration option of their choice for example, whether local administrators can choose a scheduled installation time.<br />    Local administrators will not be allowed to disable the configuration for Automatic Updates.|

### Changes to WSUS relevant to this guide
The following table summarizes key differences between the current and past versions of WSUS that are relevant to this guide.

|Windows Server and WSUS versions|Description|
|------------------|--------|
| Windows Server 2012 R2  with WSUS 6.0, and subsequent versions|starting in  Windows Server 2012 , the WSUS server role is integrated with the operating system, and the associated Group Policy settings for WSUS clients are, by default, included in Group Policy.|
| Windows Server 2008  (and earlier versions of Windows Server) with WSUS 3.2 and earlier|In  Windows Server 2008  (and earlier versions of Windows Server) using WSUS versions 3.2 (and earlier), the Group Policy settings that govern WSUS clients are not included in these Windows Server operating systems. The policy settings are in the WSUS Administrative template, **wuau.adm**. In these server versions, the WSUS Administrative template must first be added into the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) before the WSUS client settings can be configured.|

### Terms and Definitions
Following is a list of terms used in this guide.

|Term|Definition|
|----|-------|
|Automatic Updates|**A service that runs on Windows computers** (Automatic Updates): Refers to the client computer component built into the Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000 with SP3 operating systems to get updates from Microsoft Update or Windows Update.<br /><br />**Casual reference** (automatic updates): The term used to describe when the Windows Update Agent automatically schedules and downloads updates.|
|autonomous server|Use to refer to a downstream Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server on which administrators can manage WSUS components.|
|downstream server|Use to refer to a Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server that gets updates from another WSUS server rather than from Microsoft Update or Windows Update.|
|Group Policy extension (and: extension of Group Policy|A collection of settings in Group Policy that are used to control how users and computers (to whom the policies apply) can configure and use various Windows services and features. Administrators can use WSUS with Group Policy for client-side configuration of the Automatic Updates client, to help ensure that end-users can't disable or circumvent corporate update policies.<br /><br />WSUS does not require the use of active directory or Group Policy. Client configuration can also be applied by using local group policy or by modifying the Windows registry.|
|internal update service|A casual reference to a network infrastructure that uses one or more WSUS servers to distribute updates.|
|replica server|Use to refer to a downstream Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server that mirrors the approvals and settings on the upstream server to which it is connected. You cannot manage WSUS on a replica server.|
|Microsoft Update|**An Internet-based Microsoft download site:** A Microsoft Internet site that stores and distributes updates for Windows computers (device drivers), Windows operating systems and other Microsoft software products.|
|Software Update Services (SUS)|SUS was the predecessor product for Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).|
|updates|Any of a collection of software revisions, hotfixes, service packs, feature packs and device drivers that can be installed on a computer to extend functionality, or improve performance and security.|
|update files|The files required to install an update on a computer.|
|update information (also known as update metadata)|The information about an update, as opposed to the update binary files in an update package. For example, metadata supplies information for the properties of an update, thus enabling you to find out for what the update is useful. Metadata also includes Microsoft Software License Terms. The metadata package downloaded for an update is typically much smaller than the actual update file package.|
|update source|The location to which a Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server synchronizes to get update files. This location can be either Microsoft Update or an upstream WSUS server.|
|upstream server|A Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server that provides update files to another WSUS server, which in turn is referred to as a downstream server.|
|Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)|A Server Role program that runs on one or more Windows Server computers on a corporate network. A WSUS infrastructure enables you to manage updates for computers on your network to install.<br /><br />You can use WSUS to approve or decline updates before release, to force updates to install by a given date, and to obtain extensive reports on what updates each computer on your network requires. You can configure WSUS to approve certain classes of updates automatically (critical updates, security updates, service packs, drivers, etc.). WSUS also enables you to approve updates for "detection" only, so that you can see what computers will require a given update without having to install the updates.<br /><br />In a WSUS implementation, at least one WSUS server in the network must be able to connect to Microsoft Update to get available updates. Based on network security and configuration, the administrator can determine how many other servers connect directly to Microsoft Update.<br /><br />You can configure a WSUS server to get updates over the Internet from such places as:<br /><br />-   the public Microsoft Update<br />-   the public Windows Update<br />-   Microsoft Store|
|Windows Update|**An Internet-based Microsoft download site:** A Microsoft Internet site that stores and distributes updates for Windows computers (device drivers), and Windows operating systems.<br /><br />**computer service:** The name of the Windows Update service that runs on computers. Windows Update detects, downloads, and installs updates on Windows computers.<br /><br />Depending on computer and policy configurations, the Windows Update Agent can download updates from:<br /><br />-   Microsoft Update<br />-   Windows Update<br />-   Microsoft Store<br />-   An Internet (network) update service (WSUS)<br /><br />computers that are not managed in a WSUS-based environment will typically use Windows Update to connect directly - over the Internet - to Windows Update, Microsoft Update, or  Microsoft Store to obtain updates.|
|WSUS Client|A computer that receives updates from a WSUS intranet update service.<br /><br />In the case of Group Policy settings that control end-user interaction with Automatic Updates: a user of a computer in a WSUS environment.|
