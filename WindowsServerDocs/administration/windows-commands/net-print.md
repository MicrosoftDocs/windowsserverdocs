# net print

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This command has been deprecated. However, you can perform many of the same tasks using the [prnjobs command](prnjobs.md), [Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)](/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page), [PrintManagement in Powershell](/powershell/module/printmanagement), or [Script resources for IT professionals](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/ScriptCenter/site/search?f%5B0%5D.Type=RootCategory&f%5B0%5D.Value=printing&f%5B0%5D.Text=Printing).

Displays information about a specified printer queue or a specified print job, or controls a specified print job.

## Syntax

```

```

### Parameters

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `\\<computername>\<sharename>` | Specifies (by name) the computer and print queue about which you want to display information. |
| `\\<computername>` | Specifies (by name) the computer that hosts the print job you want to control. If you do not specify a computer, the local computer is assumed. Requires the `<jobnumber>` parameter. |
| `<jobnumber>` | Specifies the number of the print job you want to control. This number is assigned by the computer that hosts the print queue where the print job is sent. After a computer assigns a number to a print job, that number is not assigned to any other print jobs in any queue hosted by that computer. Required when using the `\\<computername>` parameter. |
| `[/hold | /release | /delete]` | Specifies the action to take with the print job. If you specify a job number, but don't specify any action, information about the print job is displayed.<ul><li>**/hold** - Delays the job, allowing other print jobs to bypass it until it is released.</li><li>**/release** - Releases a print job that has been delayed.</li><li>**/delete** - Removes a print job from a print queue.</li></ul> |
| help | Displays help at the command prompt. |
