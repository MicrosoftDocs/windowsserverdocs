# choice

Prompts the user to select one item from a list of single-character choices in a batch program, and then returns the index of the selected choice. If used without parameters, **choice** displays the default choices **Y** and **N**.

## Syntax

```
choice [/c [<choice1><choice2><…>]] [/n] [/cs] [/t <timeout> /d <choice>] [/m <text>]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| /c `<choice1><choice2><…>` | Specifies the list of choices to be created. Valid choices include a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and extended ASCII characters (128-254). The default list is YN, which is displayed as `[Y,N]?`. |
| /n | Hides the list of choices, although the choices are still enabled and the message text (if specified by **/m**) is still displayed. |
| /cs | Specifies that the choices are case-sensitive. By default, the choices are not case-sensitive. |
| /t `<timeout>` | Specifies the number of seconds to pause before using the default choice specified by **/d**. Acceptable values are from **0** to **9999**. If **/t** is set to **0**, **choice** does not pause before returning the default choice. |
| /d `<choice>` | Specifies the default choice to use after waiting the number of seconds specified by **/t**. The default choice must be in the list of choices specified by **/c**. |
| /m `<text>` | Specifies a message to display before the list of choices. If **/m** is not specified, only the choice prompt is displayed. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

## Remarks

- The **ERRORLEVEL** environment variable is set to the index of the key that the user selects from the list of choices. The first choice in the list returns a value of `1`, the second a value of `2`, and so on. If the user presses a key that is not a valid choice, **choice** sounds a warning beep.

- If **choice** detects an error condition, it returns an **ERRORLEVEL** value of `255`. If the user presses CTRL+BREAK or CTRL+C, **choice** returns an **ERRORLEVEL** value of `0`.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use **ERRORLEVEL** values in a batch program, you must list them in decreasing order.

## Examples

To present the choices **Y**, **N**, and **C**, type the following line in a batch file:

```
choice /c ync
```

The following prompt appears when the batch file runs the **choice** command:

```
[Y,N,C]?
```

To hide the choices **Y**, **N**, and **C**, but display the text **Yes**, **No**, or **Continue**, type the following line in a batch file:

```
choice /c ync /n /m "Yes, No, or Continue?"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the **/n** parameter, but do not use **/m**, the user is not prompted when **choice** is waiting for input.

To show both the text and the options used in the previous examples, type the following line in a batch file:

```
choice /c ync /m "Yes, No, or Continue"
```

To set a time limit of five seconds and specify **N** as the default value, type the following line in a batch file:

```
choice /c ync /t 5 /d n
```

> [!NOTE]
> In this example, if the user doesn't press a key within five seconds, **choice** selects **N** by default and returns an error value of `2`. Otherwise, **choice** returns the value corresponding to the user's choice.
