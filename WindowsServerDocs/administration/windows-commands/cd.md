# cd



Displays the name of or changes the current directory. If used with only a drive letter (for example, `cd C:`), **cd** displays the names of the current directory in the specified drive. If used without parameters, **cd** displays the current drive and directory.

> [!NOTE]
> This command is the same as the **chdir** command.

For examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).

## Syntax

```
cd [/d] [<Drive>:][<Path>]
cd [..]
chdir [/d] [<Drive>:][<Path>]
chdir [..]
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|/d|Changes the current drive as well as the current directory for a drive.|
|\<Drive>:|Specifies the drive to display or change (if different from the current drive).|
|\<Path>|Specifies the path to the directory that you want to display or change.|
|[..]|Specifies that you want to change to the parent folder.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

## Remarks

If command extensions are enabled, the following conditions apply to the **cd** command:
- The current directory string is converted to use the same case as the names on the disk. For example, `cd C:\TEMP` would set the current directory to C:\Temp if that is the case on the disk.
- Spaces are not treated as delimiters, so *Path* can contain spaces without enclosing quotation marks. For example:  
  ```
  cd username\programs\start menu
  ```  
  is the same as:  
  ```
  cd "username\programs\start menu"
  ```  
  The quotation marks are required, however, if extensions are disabled.

To disable command extensions, type:
```
cmd /e:off
```

## <a name="BKMK_examples"></a>Examples

The root directory is the top of the directory hierarchy for a drive. To return to the root directory, type:
```
cd\
```
To change the default directory on a drive that is different from the one you are on, type:
```
cd [<Drive>:\[<Directory>]]
```
To verify the change to the directory, type:
```
cd [<Drive>:]
```
