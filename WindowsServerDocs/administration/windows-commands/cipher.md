# cipher

Displays or alters the encryption of directories and files on NTFS volumes. If used without parameters, **cipher** displays the encryption state of the current directory and any files it contains.

## Syntax

```
cipher [/e | /d | /c] [/s:<directory>] [/b] [/h] [pathname [...]]
cipher /k
cipher /r:<filename> [/smartcard]
cipher /u [/n]
cipher /w:<directory>
cipher /x[:efsfile] [filename]
cipher /y
cipher /adduser [/certhash:<hash> | /certfile:<filename>] [/s:directory] [/b] [/h] [pathname [...]]
cipher /removeuser /certhash:<hash> [/s:<directory>] [/b] [/h] [<pathname> [...]]
cipher /rekey [pathname [...]]
```

### Parameters

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| /b | Aborts if an error is encountered. By default, **cipher** continues to run even if errors are encountered. |
| /c | Displays information on the encrypted file. |
| /d | Decrypts the specified files or directories. |
| /e | Encrypts the specified files or directories. Directories are marked so that files that are added afterward will be encrypted. |
| /h | Displays files with hidden or system attributes. By default, these files are not encrypted or decrypted. |
| /k | Creates a new certificate and key for use with Encrypting File System (EFS) files. If the **/k** parameter is specified, all other parameters are ignored. |
| /r:`<filename>` [/smartcard] | Generates an EFS recovery agent key and certificate, then writes them to a .pfx file (containing certificate and private key) and  a .cer file (containing only the certificate). If **/smartcard** is specified, it writes the recovery key and certificate to a smart card, and no .pfx file is generated. |
| /s:`<directory>` | Performs the specified operation on all subdirectories in the specified *directory*. |
| /u [/n] |  Finds all encrypted files on the local drive(s). If used with the **/n** parameter, no updates are made. If used without **/n**, **/u** compares the user's file encryption key or the recovery agent's key to the current ones, and updates them if they have changed. This parameter works only with **/n**. |
| /w:`<directory>` | Removes data from available unused disk space on the entire volume. If you use the **/w** parameter, all other parameters are ignored. The directory specified can be located anywhere in a local volume. If it is a mount point or points to a directory in another volume, the data on that volume is removed. |
| /x[:efsfile] [`<FileName>`] | Backs up the EFS certificate and keys to the specified file name. If used with **:efsfile**, **/x** backs up the user's certificate(s) that were used to encrypt the file. Otherwise, the user's current EFS certificate and keys are backed up. |
| /y | Displays your current EFS certificate thumbnail on the local computer. |
| /adduser [/certhash:`<hash>` | /certfile:`<filename>`] |
| /rekey | Updates the specified encrypted file(s) to use the currently configured EFS key. |
| /removeuser /certhash:`<hash>` | Removes a user from the specified file(s). The *Hash* provided for **/certhash** must be the SHA1 hash of the certificate to remove. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

### Remarks

- If the parent directory is not encrypted, an encrypted file could become decrypted when it is modified. Therefore, when you encrypt a file, you should also encrypt the parent directory.

- An administrator can add the contents of a .cer file to the EFS recovery policy to create the recovery agent for users, and then import the .pfx file to recover individual files.

- You can use multiple directory names and wildcards.

- You must put spaces between multiple parameters.

## Examples

To display the encryption status of each of the files and subdirectories in the current directory, type:

```
cipher
```

Encrypted files and directories are marked with an **E**. Unencrypted files and directories are marked with a **U**. For example, the following output indicates that the current directory and all its contents are currently unencrypted:

```
Listing C:\Users\MainUser\Documents\
New files added to this directory will not be encrypted.
U Private
U hello.doc
U hello.txt
```

To enable encryption on the Private directory used in the previous example, type:

```
cipher /e private
```

The following output displays:

```
Encrypting files in C:\Users\MainUser\Documents\
Private             [OK]
1 file(s) [or directorie(s)] within 1 directorie(s) were encrypted.
```

The **cipher** command displays the following output:

```
Listing C:\Users\MainUser\Documents\
New files added to this directory will not be encrypted.
E Private
U hello.doc
U hello.txt
```

Where the **Private** directory is now marked as encrypted.
