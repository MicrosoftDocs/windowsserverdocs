# dfsrmig

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

The `dfsrmig` command migrates SYSvol replication from File Replication Service (FRS) to Distributed File System (DFS) Replication, provides information about the progress of the migration, and modifies active directory Domain Services (AD DS) objects to support the migration.
for examples of how to use this command, see the [Examples](#BKMK_examples) section later in this document.
## Syntax
```
dfsrmig [/SetGlobalState <state> | /GetGlobalState | /GetMigrationState | /createGlobalObjects | 
/deleteRoNtfrsMember [<read_only_domain_controller_name>] | /deleteRoDfsrMember [<read_only_domain_controller_name>] | /?]
```

This option enables you to initiate and control the migration process by setting the global migration state in AD DS on the PDC emulator. If the PDC emulator is not available, this command fails.<br /><br /> You can only set the global migration state to a stable state. The valid values for *state*, therefore, are **0** for the start state, **1** for the Prepared state, **2** for the Redirected state, and **3** for the Eliminated state.<br /><br />Migration to the Eliminated state is irreversible and rollback from that state is not possible, so use a value of **3** for *state* only when you are fully committd to using DFS Replication for SYSvol replication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Only stable migration states can be global migration states, so the results that the **dfsrmig** command reports with the **/GetGlobalState** option correspond to the states you can set with the **/SetGlobalState** option.<br /><br />You should run the **dfsrmig** command with the **/GetGlobalState** option only on the PDC emulator. active directory replication replicates the global state to the other domain controllers in the domain, but replication latencies can cause inconsistencies if you run the **dfsrmig** command with the **/GetGlobalState** option on a domain controller other than the PDC emulator. To check the local migration status of a domain controller other than the PDC emulator, use the **/GetMigrationState** option instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The output of the **dsfrmig** command when you use the **/GetMigrationState** option indicates whether or not migration to the current global state is complete, and it lists the local migration state for any domain controllers that have not reached the current global migration state. Local migration state for domain controllers can include transition states for domain controllers that have not reached the current global migration state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                   /createGlobalObjects                    | creates the global objects and settings in AD DS that DFS Replication uses.<br /><br />You should not need to use this option during a normal migration process, because the DFS Replication service automatically creates these AD DS objects and settings during the migration from the start state to the Prepared state. Use this option to manually create these objects and settings in the following situations:<br /><br />-   **A new read-only domain controller is promoted during migration**. The DFS Replication service automatically creates the AD DS objects and settings for DFS Replication during the migration from the start state to the Prepared state. If a new read-only domain controller is promoted in the domain after this transition, but before migration to the Eliminated state, then the objects that correspond to the newly activated read-only domain controller are not created in AD DS causing replication and migration to fail.<br />-   In this case, you can run the **dfsrmig** command wth the **/createGlobalObjects** option to manually create the objects on any read-only domain controllers that do not already have them. Running this command does not affect the domain controllers that already have the objects and settings for the DFS Replication service.<br />-   **The global settings for the DFS Replication service are missing or were deleted**. If these settings are missing for a particular domain controller, migration from the start state to the Prepared state stalls at the Preparing transition state for the domain controller. In this case, you can use the **dfsrmig** command with the **/createGlobalObjects** option to manually create the settings. **Note:** Because the global AD DS settings for the DFS Replication service for a read-only domain controller are created on the PDC emulator, these settings need to replicate to the read-only domain controller from the PDC emulator before the DFS Replication service on the read-only domain controller can use these settings.

## Remarks
- dfsrmig.exe, the migration tool for the DFS Replication service, is installed with the DFS Replication service.
  for a new  Windows Server 2008  server, Dcpromo.exe installs and starts the DFS Replication service when you promote the computer to a domain controller. When you upgrade a server from Windows Server 2003 to  Windows Server 2008 , the upgrade process installs and starts the DFS Replication service. You do not need to install the DFS Replication role service to have the DFS Replication service installed and started.
- The **dfsrmig** tool is supported only on domain controllers that run at the  Windows Server 2008  domain functional level, because SYSvol migration from FRS to DFS Replication is only possible on domain controllers that operate at the  Windows Server 2008  domain functional level.
- You can run the **dfsrmig** command on any domain controller, but operations that create or manipulate AD DS objects are only allowed on read-write capable domain controllers (not on read-only domain controllers).
- Running **dfsrmig** without any options displays help at the command prompt.
  ## <a name="BKMK_examples"></a>Examples
  To set the global migration state to prepared (**1**) and initiate migration to or rollback from the Prepared state, type:
  ```
  dfsrmig /SetGlobalState 1
  ```
  To set the global migration state to start (**0**) and initiate rollback to the start state, type:
  ```
  dfsrmig /SetGlobalState 0
  ```
  To display the global migration state, type:
  ```
  dfsrmig /GetGlobalState
  ```
  This example shows typical output from the **dfsrmig /GetGlobalState** command.
  ```
  Current DFSR global state:  Prepared 
  Succeeded.
  ```
  To display the information about whether the local migration states on all of the domain controllers match the global migration state and the local migration states for any domain controllers where the local state does not match the global state, type:
  ```
  dfsrmig /GetMigrationState
  ```
  This example shows typical output from the **dfsrmig /GetMigrationState** command when the local migration states on all of the domain controllers match the global migration state.
  ```
  All Domain Controllers have migrated successfully to Global state ( Prepared ).
  Migration has reached a consistent state on all Domain Controllers.
  Succeeded.
  ```
  This example shows typical output from the **dfsrmig /GetMigrationState** command when the local migration states on some domain controllers do not match the global migration state.
  ```
    The following Domain Controllers are not in sync with Global state ( Prepared ):
    Domain Controller (Local Migration State)   DC type
    =========
    CONTOSO-DC2 ( start )   ReadOnly DC
    CONTOSO-DC3 ( Preparing )   Writable DC
    Migration has not yet reached a consistent state on all domain controllers
    State information might be stale due to AD latency.
  ```
To create the global objects and settings that DFS Replication uses in AD DS on domain controllers where those settings were not created automatically during migration or where those settings are missing, type:
```
dfsrmig /createGlobalObjects
```
To delete the global AD DS settings for FRS replication for a read-only domain controller named contoso-dc2 if those settings were not deleted automatically deleted by the migration process, type:
```
dfsrmig /deleteRoNtfrsMember contoso-dc2
```
To delete the global AD DS settings for FRS replication for all read-only domain controllers if those settings were not deleted automatically by the migration process, type:
```
dfsrmig /deleteRoNtfrsMember
```
To delete the global AD DS settings for DFS Replication for a read-only domain controller named contoso-dc2 if those settings were not deleted automatically by the migration process, type:
```
dfsrmig /deleteRoDfsrMember contoso-dc2
```
To delete the global AD DS settings for DFS Replication for all read-only domain controllers if those settings were not deleted automatically by the migration process, type:
```
dfsrmig /deleteRoDfsrMember
```
