# tree

Displays the directory structure of a path or of the disk in a drive graphically. The structure displayed by this command depends upon the parameters that you specify at the command prompt. If you don't specify a drive or path, this command displays the tree structure beginning with the current directory of the current drive.

## Syntax

```
tree [<drive>:][<path>] [/f] [/a]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| `<drive>:` | Specifies the drive that contains the disk for which you want to display the directory structure. |
| `<path>` | Specifies the directory for which you want to display the directory structure. |
| /f | Displays the names of the files in each directory. |
| /a | Specifies to use text characters instead of graphic characters to show the lines that link subdirectories. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

## Examples

To display the names of all the subdirectories on the disk in your current drive, type:

```
tree \
```

To display, one screen at a time, the files in all the directories on drive C, type:

```
tree c:\ /f | more
```

To print a list of all the directories on drive C, type:

```
tree c:\ /f  prn
```
