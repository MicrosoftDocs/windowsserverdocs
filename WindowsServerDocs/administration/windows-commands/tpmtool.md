## Syntax

```
tpmtool /parameter [<arguments>]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| getdeviceinformation | Displays the basic information of the TPM. See the [Win32_Tpm::IsReadyInformation method parameters](/windows/win32/secprov/win32-tpm-isreadyinformation#parameters) article for details about the information flag values. |
| gatherlogs [output directory path] | Collects TPM logs and places them in the specified directory. If that directory doesn't exist, it's created. By default, the log files are placed in the current directory. The possible files generated are:<ul><li>TpmEvents.evtx</li><li>TpmInformation.txt</li><li>SRTMBoot.dat</li><li>SRTMResume.dat</li><li>DRTMBoot.dat</li><li>DRTMResume.dat</li></ul> |
| drivertracing `[start | stop]` | Starts or stops collecting TPM driver traces. The trace log, *TPMTRACE.etl*, is created and placed in the current directory. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

## Examples

To display the basic information of the TPM, type:

```
tpmtool getdeviceinformation
```

To collect TPM logs and place them in the current directory, type:

```
tpmtool gatherlogs
```

To collect TPM logs and place them in `C:\Users\Public`, type:

```
tpmtool gatherlogs C:\Users\Public
```

To collect TPM driver traces, type:

```
