# netsh ipsec

The `netsh ipsec` command is used to configure and manage Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) policies and settings. IPsec is a comprehensive protocol suite that secures network communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet within a communication session, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data being transmitted.

| ipsec `static add filteraction` | Adds a filter action within an IPsec policy. A filter action specifies the actions that should be taken on traffic that matches the criteria of an IPsec filter. These actions determine how matching traffic is handled, such as whether it should be allowed, blocked, or secured. <br><br> Other subparameters: <li> `name` <li> `description` <li> `qmpfs` <li> `inpass` <li> `soft` <li> `action` <li> `qmsecmethods` </li><br> See [Remarks](#remarks) for description details. |
| ipsec `static add filterlist` | A new filter list in an IPsec policy configuration in Windows. A filter list is essentially a collection of one or more filters, each defining specific criteria for network traffic, such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. <br><br> Other subparameters: <li> `name` <li> `description` </li><br> See [Remarks](#remarks) for description details. |
| ipsec `static add policy` | Adds a new IPsec policy. This command doesn't apply any specific rules or filters by itself, rather, it serves as the starting point for defining how you want to manage or secure network traffic on the device. <br><br> Other subparameters: <li> `name` <li> `description` <li> `mmpfs` <li> `qmpermm` <li> `mmlifetime` <li> `activatedefaultrule` <li> `pollinginterval` <li> `assign` <li> `mmsecmethods` </li><br> See [Remarks](#remarks) for description details. |

| ipsec `static delete filter` | Removes a specified filter from the IPsec configuration. Filters in IPsec are used to define criteria for matching network traffic, such as specifying particular IP addresses, protocols, or port numbers to which certain rules or actions should apply. <br><br> Other subparameters: <li> `filterlist` <li> `srcaddr` <li> `dstaddr` <li> `protocol` <li> `mirrored` <li> `srcmask` <li> `dstmask` <li> `srcport` <li> `dstport` </li><br> See [Remarks](#remarks) for description details. |
| ipsec `static delete all` <br><br> netsh `ipsec static delete` [`filteraction` \| `filterlist` \| `policy`] | Removes `all` IPsec policies, rules, filters, filter actions, and associated components from the system. This command can also remove *specific* components or from the IPsec configuration. <br><br> Other subparameters: <li> `name` </li><br> See [Remarks](#remarks) for description details. |
| ipsec `static delete rule` | Removes a specific rule from an existing IPsec policy. <br><br> Other subparameters: <li> `name` <li> `id` <li> `all` <li> `policy` </li><br> See [Remarks](#remarks) for description details. |
| ipsec `static` [`exportpolicy` \| `importpolicy`] `file=<string>` | This command is used to manage the export and import of IPsec policies, allowing you to save or load IPsec configurations to or from a file. This can be useful for backing up configurations or applying the same configuration to multiple systems. <br><br><li> `exportpolicy` - Exports the current IPsec policy configuration to a specified file. <li>  `importpolicy` - Imports an IPsec policy configuration from a specified file. <li> `file` - Specifies the path and name of the file you wish to use for exporting or importing the policy. |
| ipsec `static set batch` `mode=(enable|disable)` | Executes multiple IPsec commands in a group, reducing the chances of policy inconsistencies during changes. When you enable batch mode, you can enter multiple IPsec commands, and they're queued up. Once you complete entering the commands and exit batch mode, the policy changes are applied all at once. <br><br> When you **enable** batch mode, it allows multiple IPsec policy commands to be processed as a batch, which means they can be applied together to minimize the time during which policy changes might be inconsistent or incomplete. When you **disable** batch mode, each command is executed independently as you enter them. |
| ipsec `static set defaultrule` | Configures the default IPsec rule that is applied in the absence of more specific rules. <br><br> Other subparameters: <li> `policy` <li> `qmpfs` <li> `activate` <li> `qmsecmethods` <li> `kerberos` <li> `psk` <li> `rootca` </li><br> See [Remarks](#remarks) for description details. |

Options are: <br> `local`: Indicates that the policies are stored on the local computer. <br> `domain`: Indicates that the policies are stored in a domain-level policy, which is managed through Active Directory (AD). <br><br> `domain=` : Designates the domain name when the `location` is set to `domain`. Replace `<string>` with the actual domain name you're using. This is applicable only if the location is specified as `domain`, and it determines which domain's policies are being accessed or altered. |
| ipsec `static show all` | Displays all *currently* configured IPsec policies, rules, filter lists, and actions. <br><br> Other subparameters: <li> `format` <li> `wide` </li><br> See [Remarks](#remarks) for description details. |

  - *AH[HashAlg]+ESP[ConfAlg,AuthAlg]:k/s*

    Where:

    - **ConfAlg**: Encryption algorithm (`DES`, `3DES`, or `None`)

    - **AuthAlg**: Authentication algorithm (`MD5`, `SHA1`, or `None`)

    - **HashAlg**: Hash algorithm (`MD5` or `SHA1`)

    - **k**: Lifetime in kilobytes

    - **s**: Lifetime in seconds

- **srcaddr** / **dstaddr**: Specifies the source address (starting point of the network traffic) and destination address (endpoint of the network traffic) respectively. Options are:

  - `ipv4`: Designates an IPv4 address.

  - `ipv6`: Designates an IPv6 address.

  - `ipv4-ipv4`: Represents an IPv4 range.

  - `ipv6-ipv6`: Represents an IPv6 range.

  - `dns`: Uses a DNS name to specify the source *or* the destination.

  - `server`: Refers to a server address.

- **mmpolicy**: Refers to the Main Mode policy to be used for the rule. Main Mode policies define the security settings for establishing secure, authenticated communications.

- **qmpolicy**: Indicates the Quick Mode policy to be used, which defines the security settings for maintaining secured traffic after the initial connection is established.

- **protocol**: This parameter allows you to match the rule to target specific IP protocols. Options are:

  - `ANY`: Allows all protocols.

  - `ICMP`: Also represented by the protocol *number* `1`.

  - `TCP`: Also represented by the protocol *number* `6`.

  - `UDP`: Also represented by the protocol *number* `17`.

  - `RAW`: Represents raw socket access, which allows applications to have direct access to lower-level protocols. This can be useful for applications that need to construct their own packet headers or work outside the standard transport protocols.

- **srcport**: Defines the source *port number* for the traffic. This parameter specifies the port from which traffic originates.

- **dstport**: Defines the destination *port number* for the traffic. This parameter specifies the port to which traffic is sent.

- **mirrored**: Indicates whether the rule should automatically be applied in both directions. Values are `yes` or `no`.

- **conntype**: Specifies the type of connection. This determines the network interface to which the rule applies. Options include:

  - `lan`: Specifies that the rule addition or removal applies only to a Local Area Network (LAN) or wireless connection.

- **kerberos**: Indicates whether Kerberos authentication is used. Options are `yes` or `no`.

- **psk**: Refers to the pre-shared key used in authentication. Specifying this parameter is necessary if the authentication method you're configuring relies on it. If you're using a different type of authentication, such as certificates, then the `psk` parameter isn't used.

- **rootca**: Provides options for root certificate authorities. The `certmap` option determines whether certificates are mapped (`yes` or `no`), and `excludecaname` determines if CA names are excluded (`yes` or `no`).

- **description**: Specifies a *description* you give to a filter, filteraction, filterlist, policy, or rule.

- **pollinginterval**: Specifies the interval, in *seconds*, which the system checks for changes in the IPsec policy.

- **assign**: Specifies whether the newly created or modified IPsec policy should be set as the active policy. Options are `yes` or  `no`.

- **action**: This parameter specifies the type of action that should be taken when a packet matches a particular IPsec filter. Options are:

  - `permit`: Allows the matching traffic to pass through without any IPsec protection.

  - `block`: Prevents the matching traffic from passing through.

  - `negotiate`: Requires that the matching traffic performs IPsec negotiation to establish a secure connection.

- **filterlist**: Specifies the *name* (the `<string>` value) of the filter list you created or wish to reference.

- **filteraction**: Specifies the *name* (the `<string>` value) of the action you created within the IPsec policy. Options are:

  - `permit`: Allows the matching traffic to pass through without any IPsec protection.

  - `block`: Prevents the matching traffic from passing through.

  - `negotiate`: Requires that the matching traffic performs IPsec negotiation to establish a secure connection.

- **activate**: Specifies to activate (`yes`) or deactivate (`no`) a specific rule within a filter list, or the default rule for IPsec policies. The default rule typically applies to traffic that doesn't match any specific filters or rules.

- **activatedefaultrule**: Specifies whether the default rule within that policy should be active (`yes`) or inactive (`no`) from the start. This command is also used to modify (set) an existing IPsec policy to change the activation state of the default rule.

- **tunnel**: Specifies an addition or modification of how traffic is tunneled through a rule. Options are:

  - `ip`: This option specifies that the rule uses an IP address for the tunnel. You typically provide the tunnel's start and end IP addresses if you're configuring an IPsec tunnel mode.

  - `dns`: This option specifies that the rule uses DNS names to define the endpoints of the tunnel. This is useful when you want to set up tunnels using domain names rather than static IP addresses.

- **wide**: Shows detailed information in a more verbose format. Options are `yes` or  `no`.

- **level**: Specifies the amount of detail to dump in an output. Options are:

  - `verbose`: Provides a detailed, in-depth view, which can be useful for troubleshooting or comprehensive analysis.

  - `normal`: Displays standard information, offering a more general output.

- **format**: Specifies the presentation style of the output. Options are:

  - `list`: Displays the information in a list format, which is often easier to read for detailed inspection of individual entries.

  - `table`: Displays the information in a table format, which can be more compact and provide a quick comparison of multiple entries at a glance.
