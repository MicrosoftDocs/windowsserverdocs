On basic master boot record (MBR) disks, marks the system partition or boot partition with focus as inactive.

## Syntax

```
inactive
```

## Remarks

> [!CAUTION]
> Your computer might not start without an active partition. Do not mark a system or boot partition as inactive unless you are an experienced user with a thorough understanding of the Windows family of operating systems.</br>> If you are unable to start your computer after marking the system or boot partition as inactive, insert the Windows Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive, restart the computer, and then repair the partition using the **fixmbr** and **fixboot** commands in the Recovery Console.
> -   After you mark the system partition or boot partition as inactive, your computer starts from the next option specified in the BIOS, such as the CD-ROM drive or a Pre-Boot eXecution Environment (PXE).
> -   An active system or boot partition must be selected for this operation to succeed. Use the **select partition** command to select the active partition and shift the focus to it.
