# ntcmdprompt

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Runs the command interpreter **Cmd.exe**, rather than **Command.com**, after running a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) or after starting the command prompt from within an MS-DOS application.

## Syntax

```
ntcmdprompt
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

#### Remarks

- When **Command.com** is running, some features of **Cmd.exe**, such as the **doskey** display of command history, aren't available. If you would prefer to run the **Cmd.exe** command interpreter after you've started a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) or started the command prompt from within an application based on MS-DOS, you can use the **ntcmdprompt** command. However, keep in mind that the TSR may not be available for use when you are running **Cmd.exe**. You can include the **ntcmdprompt** command in your **Config.nt** file or the equivalent custom startup file in an application's program information file (Pif).
