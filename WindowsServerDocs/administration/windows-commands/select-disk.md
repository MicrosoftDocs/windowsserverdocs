# select disk

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Selects the specified disk and shifts the focus to it.

## Syntax

```
select disk={<n>|<disk path>|system|next}
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| `<n>` | Specifies the number of the disk to receive focus. You can view the numbers for all the disks on the computer by using the **list disk** command in DiskPart.<p>**NOTE**<br>When configuring systems with multiple disks, don't use **select disk=0** to specify the system disk. The computer may reassign disk numbers when you reboot, and different computers with the same disk configuration can have different disk numbers. |
| `<disk path>` | Specifies the location of the disk to receive focus, for example, `PCIROOT(0)#PCI(0F02)#atA(C00T00L00)`. To view the location path of a disk, select it and then type **detail disk**. |
| system | On BIOS computers, this option specifies that disk 0 receives focus. On EFI computers, the disk containing the EFI system partition (ESP), used for the current boot, receives focus. On EFI computers, the command will fail if there's no ESP, if there's more than one ESP, or if the computer is booted from Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE). |
| next | After a disk is selected, this option iterates over all disks in the disk list. When you run this option, the next disk in the list receives focus. |

## Examples

To shift the focus to disk 1, type:

```
select disk=1
```

To select a disk by using its location path, type:

```
select disk=PCIROOT(0)#PCI(0100)#atA(C00T00L01)
```

To shift the focus to the system disk, type:

```
select disk=system
```

To shift the focus to the next disk on the computer, type:

```
select disk=next
```
