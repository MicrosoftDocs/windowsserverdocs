# Commands by Server role



A server role describes the primary function of the server. Administrators can choose to dedicate an entire server to one role, or install multiple server roles and sub-roles on a single computer. Each role might include additional command-line tools, installed as part of the role. The following topics provide a list of commands associated with each server role.
