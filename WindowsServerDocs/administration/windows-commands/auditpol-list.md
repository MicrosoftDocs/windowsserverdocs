# auditpol list

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Lists audit policy categories and subcategories, or lists users for whom a per-user audit policy is defined.

To perform *list* operations on the *per-user* policy, you must have **Read** permission for that object set in the security descriptor. You can also perform *list* operations if you have the **Manage auditing and security log** (SeSecurityPrivilege) user right. However, this right allows additional access that is not necessary to perform the overall *list* operations.

## Syntax

```
auditpol /list
[/user|/category|subcategory[:<categoryname>|<{guid}>|*]]
[/v] [/r]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | -------- |
| /user | Retrieves all users for whom the per-user audit policy has been defined. If used with the /v parameter, the security identifier (SID) of the user is also displayed. |
| /category | Displays the names of categories understood by the system. If used with the /v parameter, the category globally unique identifier (GUID) is also displayed. |
| /subcategory | Displays the names of subcategories and their associated GUID. |
| /v | Displays the GUID with the category or subcategory, or when used with /user, displays the SID of each user. |
| /r | Displays the output as a report in comma-separated value (CSV) format. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

## Examples
