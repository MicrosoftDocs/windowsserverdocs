# rem



Records comments (remarks) in a batch file or CONFIG.SYS. If no comment is specified, **rem** adds vertical spacing.



## Syntax

```
rem [<Comment>]
```

### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|\<Comment>|Specifies a string of characters to include as a comment.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

## Remarks

-   The **rem** command does not display comments on the screen. You must use the **echo on** command in your batch or CONFIG.SYS file to display comments on the screen.
-   You cannot use a redirection character (**<** or **>**) or pipe (**|**) in a batch file comment.
-   Although you can use **rem** without a comment to add vertical spacing to a batch file, you can also use blank lines. Blank lines are ignored when a batch program is processed.

## Examples

To shows a batch file that uses remarks for comments and for vertical spacing:
```
@echo off
rem  This batch program formats and checks new disks.
rem  It is named Checknew.bat.
rem
rem echo Insert new disk in Drive B.
pause 
format b: /v chkdsk b: 
```
To include an explanatory comment before the **prompt** command in your CONFIG.SYS file, add the following lines to CONFIG.SYS:
```
rem Set prompt to indicate current directory
prompt $p$g
```
