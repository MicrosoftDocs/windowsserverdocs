# bitsadmin complete

Completes the job. Use this switch after the job moves to the transferred state. Otherwise, only those files that have been successfully transferred will be available.

## Syntax

```
bitsadmin /complete <job>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| job | The job's display name or GUID. |

## Example

To complete the *myDownloadJob* job, after it reaches the `TRANSFERRED` state:

```
bitsadmin /complete myDownloadJob
```

If multiple jobs use *myDownloadJob* as their name, you must use the job's GUID to uniquely identify it for completion.
