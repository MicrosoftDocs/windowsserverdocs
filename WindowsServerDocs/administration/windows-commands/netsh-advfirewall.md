### Firewall parameter remarks

# [add](#tab/firewalladd)

```
- Add a new inbound or outbound rule to the firewall policy.
- Rule name should be unique and can't be "all".
- If a remote computer or user group is specified, security must be: authenticate, authenc, authdynenc, or authnoencap.
- Setting security to authdynenc allows systems to dynamically negotiate the use of encryption for traffic that matches a given Windows Defender Firewall rule. Encryption is negotiated based on existing connection security rule properties. This option enables the ability of a machine to accept the first TCP or UDP packet of an inbound IPsec connection as long as it's secured, but not encrypted, using IPsec. Once the first packet is processed, the server renegotiates the connection and upgrade it so that all subsequent communications are fully encrypted.
- If action=bypass, the remote computer group must be specified when dir=in.
- If service=any, the rule applies only to services.
- ICMP type or code can be "any".
- Edge can only be specified for inbound rules.
- AuthEnc and authnoencap can't be used together.
