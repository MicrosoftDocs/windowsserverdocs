### Exit (return) codes

Value | Description
-- | --
0 | No files were copied. No failure was encountered.  No files were mismatched. The files already exist in the destination directory; therefore, the copy operation was skipped.
1 | All files were copied successfully.
2 | There are some additional files in the destination directory that are not present in the source directory. No files were copied.
3 | Some files were copied. Additional files were present. No failure was encountered.
5 | Some files were copied. Some files were mismatched. No failure was encountered.
6 | Additional  files and mismatched files exist. No files were copied and no failures were encountered. This means that the files already exist in the destination directory.
7 | Files were copied, a file mismatch was present, and additional files were present.
8 | Several files did not copy.

> [!NOTE]
> Any value greater than 8 indicates that there was at least one failure during the copy operation.

### Remarks

-   The **/mir** option is equivalent to the **/e** plus **/purge** options with one small difference in behavior:  
    -   With the **/e** plus **/purge** options, if the destination directory exists, the destination directory security settings are not overwritten.
    -   With the **/mir** option, if the destination directory exists, the destination directory security settings are overwritten.
