# robocopy

Copies file data from one location to another.

## Syntax

```
robocopy <source> <destination> [<file>[ ...]] [<options>]
```

For example, to copy a file named *yearly-report.mov* from *c:\reports* to a file share *\\marketing\videos* while enabling multi-threading for higher performance (with the **/mt** parameter) and the ability to restart the transfer in case it's interrupted (with the **/z** parameter), type:

```dos
robocopy c:\reports '\\marketing\videos' yearly-report.mov /mt /z
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| `<source>` | Specifies the path to the source directory. |
| `<destination>` | Specifies the path to the destination directory. |
| `<file>` | Specifies the file or files to be copied. Wildcard characters (**&#42;** or **?**) are supported. If you don't specify this parameter, `*.` is used as the default value. |
| `<options>` | Specifies the options to use with the **robocopy** command, including **copy**, **file**, **retry**, **logging**, and **job** options. |

#### Copy options

|--|--|
| /s | Copies subdirectories. This option automatically excludes empty directories. |
| /e | Copies subdirectories. This option automatically includes empty directories. |
| /lev:`<n>` | Copies only the top *n* levels of the source directory tree. |
| /z | Copies files in restartable mode. |
| /b | Copies files in Backup mode. |
| /zb | Uses restartable mode. If access is denied, this option uses Backup mode. |
| /efsraw | Copies all encrypted files in EFS RAW mode. |
| /copy:`<copyflags>` | Specifies which file properties to copy. The valid values for this option are:<ul><li>**D** - Data</li><li>**A** - Attributes</li><li>**T** - Time stamps</li><li>**S** - NTFS access control list (ACL)</li><li>**O** - Owner information</li><li>**U** - Auditing information</li></ul>The default value for this option is **DAT** (data, attributes, and time stamps). |
| /dcopy:`<copyflags>`| Specifies what to copy in directories. The valid values for this option are:<ul><li>**D** - Data</li><li>**A** - Attributes</li><li>**T** - Time stamps</li></ul>The default value for this option is **DA** (data and attributes). |
| /sec | Copies files with security (equivalent to **/copy:DATS**). |

| /purge | Deletes destination files and directories that no longer exist in the source. Using this option with the **/e** option and a destination directory, allows the destination directory security settings to not be overwritten. |
| /mir | Mirrors a directory tree (equivalent to **/e** plus **/purge**). Using this option with the **/e** option and a destination directory, overwrites the destination directory security settings. |
| /mov | Moves files, and deletes them from the source after they are copied. |
| /move | Moves files and directories, and deletes them from the source after they are copied. |
| /a+:[RASHCNET] | Adds the specified attributes to copied files.  The valid values for this option are: <ul><li>**R** - Read only</li><li>**A** - Archive</li><li>**S** - System</li><li>**H** - Hidden</li><li>**C** - Compressed</li><li>**N** - Not content indexed</li><li>**E** - Encrypted</li><li>**T** - Temporary</li></ul> |

| /mon:`<n>` | Monitors the source, and runs again when more than *n* changes are detected. |
| /mot:`<m>` | Monitors the source, and runs again in *m* minutes, if changes are detected. |
| /MT`[:n]` | Creates multi-threaded copies with *n* threads. *n* must be an integer between 1 and 128. The default value for *n* is 8. For better performance, redirect your output using **/log** option.<p>The **/mt** parameter can't be used with the **/ipg** and **/efsraw** parameters. |
| /rh:hhmm-hhmm | Specifies run times when new copies may be started. |
| /pf | Checks run times on a per-file (not per-pass) basis. |
| /ipg:n | Specifies the inter-packet gap to free bandwidth on slow lines. |
