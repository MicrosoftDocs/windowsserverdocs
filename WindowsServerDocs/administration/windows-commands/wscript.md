# wscript



Windows Script Host provides an environment in which users can execute scripts in a variety of languages that use a variety of object models to perform tasks.

## Syntax

```
wscript [<scriptname>] [/b] [/d] [/e:<engine>] [{/h:cscript|/h:wscript}] [/i] [/job:<identifier>] [{/logo|/nologo}] [/s] [/t:<number>] [/x] [/?] [<ScriptArguments>]
```

#### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|scriptname|Specifies the path and file name of the script file.|
|/b|Specifies batch mode, which does not display alerts, scripting errors, or input prompts. This is the opposite of **/i**.|
|/d|Starts the debugger.|
|/e|Specifies the engine that is used to run the script. This lets you run scripts that use a custom file name extension. Without the /e parameter, you can only run scripts that use registered file name extensions. For example, if you try to run this command:<br>```cscript test.admin```<br>You will receive this error message: Input Error: There is no script engine for file extension .admin.<br>One advantage of using nonstandard file name extensions is that it guards against accidentally double-clicking a script and running something you really did not want to run. <br>This does not create a permanent association between the .admin file name extension and VBScript. Each time you run a script that uses a .admin file name extension, you will need to use the /e parameter.|
|/h:cscript|Registers **cscript.exe** as the default script host for running scripts.|
|/h:wscript|Registers **wscript.exe** as the default script host for running scripts. This is the default when the **/h** option is omitted.|
|/i|Specifies interactive mode, which displays alerts, scripting errors, and input prompts.</br>This is the default and the opposite of **/b**.|
|/job:\<identifier>|Runs the job identified by *identifier* in a **.wsf** script file.|
|/logo|Specifies that the Windows Script Host banner is displayed in the console before the script runs.</br>This is the default and the opposite of **/nologo**.|
|/nologo|Specifies that the Windows Script Host banner is not displayed before the script runs. This is the opposite of **/logo**.|
|/s|Saves the current command prompt options for the current user.|
|/t:\<number>|Specifies the maximum time the script can run (in seconds). You can specify up to 32,767 seconds.</br>The default is no time limit.|
|/x|Starts the script in the debugger.|
|ScriptArguments|Specifies the arguments passed to the script. Each script argument must be preceded by a slash (/).|
|/?|Displays Help at the command prompt.|

## Remarks

-   Performing this task does not require you to have administrative credentials. Therefore, as a security best practice, consider performing this task as a user without administrative credentials.
-   To open a command prompt, on the **Start** screen, type **cmd**, and then click **command prompt**.
-   Each parameter is optional; however, you cannot specify script arguments without specifying a script. If you do not specify a script or any script arguments, **wscript.exe** displays the **Windows Script Host Settings** dialog box, which you can use to set global scripting properties for all scripts that **wscript.exe** runs on the local computer.
-   The **/t** parameter prevents excessive running of scripts by setting a timer. When the time exceeds the specified value, **wscript** interrupts the script engine and ends the process.
-   Windows script files usually have one of the following file name extensions: **.wsf**, **.vbs**, **.js**.
-   If you double-click a script file with an extension that has no association, the **Open With** dialog box appears. Select **wscript** or **cscript**, and then select **Always use this program to open this file type**. This registers **wscript.exe** or **cscript.exe** as the default script host for files of this file type.
-   You can set properties for individual scripts. See [Windows Script Host overview](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc738350(v=ws.10)) for more information.
-   Windows Script Host can use **.wsf** script files. Each **.wsf** file can use multiple scripting engines and perform multiple jobs.
