# atmadm

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Monitors connections and addresses that are registered by the atM call Manager on an asynchronous transfer mode (atM) network. You can use **atmadm** to display statistics for incoming and outgoing calls on atM adapters. Used without parameters, **atmadm** displays statistics for monitoring the status of active atM connections.

## Syntax

```
atmadm [/c][/a][/s]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | -------- |
| /c | Displays call information for all current connections to the atM network adapter installed on this computer. |
| /a | Displays the registered atM network service access point (NSAP) address for each adapter installed in this computer. |
| /s | Displays statistics for monitoring the status of active atM connections. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

### Remarks

- The **atmadm /c** command produces output similar to the following:
