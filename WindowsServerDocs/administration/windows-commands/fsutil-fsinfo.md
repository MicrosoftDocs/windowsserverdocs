```

To query drive F for NTFS-specific volume information, type:

```
fsutil fsinfo ntfsinfo f:
```

Output similar to the following displays:

```
NTFS Volume Serial Number : 0xe660d46a60d442cb
Number Sectors : 0x00000000010ea04f

Mft Zone End : 0x0000000000004700
```

To query the file system's underlying hardware for sector information, type:

```
fsinfo sectorinfo d:
```

D:\>fsutil fsinfo sectorinfo d:
LogicalBytesPerSector : 4096
PhysicalBytesPerSectorForAtomicity : 4096
Trim Not Supported
DAX capable
```

To query the file system statistics for drive E, type:

```
fsinfo statistics e:
```

Output similar to the following displays:

```
