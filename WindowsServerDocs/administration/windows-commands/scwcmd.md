# Scwcmd

> Applies To: Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

The Scwcmd.exe command-line tool included with the Security Configuration Wizard (SCW) can be used to perform the following tasks:
-   Configure one or many servers with an SCW-generated policy.
-   Analyze one or many servers with an SCW-generated policy.
-   View analysis results in HTML format.
-   Roll back SCW policies.
-   Transform an SCW-generated policy into native files that are supported by Group Policy.
-   Register a Security Configuration Database extension with SCW.

When you use **scwcmd** to configure, analyze, or roll back a policy on a remote server, SCW must be installed on the remote server.
