Converts file allocation table (Fat) and Fat32 volumes to the NTFS file system, leaving existing files and directories intact at startup after **autochk** runs. volumes converted to the NTFS file system cannot be converted back to Fat or Fat32.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't run **autoconv** from the command-line. This can only run at startup, if set through **convert.exe**.
