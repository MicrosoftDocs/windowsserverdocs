Selects the specified partition and shifts the focus to it. This command can also be used to display the partition that currently has the focus in the selected disk.

## Syntax

```
select partition=<n>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| partition=`<n>` | The number of the partition to receive the focus. You can view the numbers for all partitions on the disk currently selected by using the **list partition** command in DiskPart. |

#### Remarks

- Before you can select a partition you must first select a disk using the **select disk** command.

  - If no partition number is specified, this option displays the partition that currently has the focus in the selected disk.

  - If a volume is selected with a corresponding partition, the partition is automatically selected.

  - If a partition is selected with a corresponding volume, the volume is automatically selected.

## Examples

To shift the focus to *partition 3*, type:

```
select partitition=3
```

To display the partition that currently has the focus in the selected disk, type:

```
select partition
```
