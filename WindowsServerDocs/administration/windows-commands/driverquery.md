# driverquery

Enables an administrator to display a list of installed device drivers and their properties. If used without parameters, **driverquery** runs on the local computer.

## Syntax

```
driverquery [/s <system> [/u [<domain>\]<username> [/p <password>]]] [/fo {table | list | csv}] [/nh] [/v | /si]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- |------------ |
| /s `<system>` | Specifies the name or IP address of a remote computer. Do not use backslashes. The default is the local computer. |
| /u `[<domain>]<username>` | Runs the command with the credentials of the user account as specified by *user* or *domain\user*. By default, */s* uses the credentials of the user who is currently logged on to the computer that is issuing the command. **/u** can't be used unless **/s** is specified. |
| /p `<password>` | Specifies the password of the user account that is specified in the **/u** parameter. **/p** cannot be used unless **/u** is specified. |
| /fo table | Formats the output as a table. This is the default. |
| /fo list | Formats the output as a list. |
| /fo csv | Formats the output with comma-separated values. |
| /nh | Omits the header row from the displayed driver information. Not valid if the **/fo** parameter is set to **list**. |

| /si | Provides information about signed drivers. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |
