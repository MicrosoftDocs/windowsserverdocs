For more information, see [Install or Uninstall Roles, Role Services, or Features](/administration/server-manager/install-or-uninstall-roles-role-services-or-features).

## Syntax

```
servermanagercmd -query [[[<drive>:]<path>]<query.xml>] [-logpath [[<drive>:]<path>]<log.txt>]
servermanagercmd -inputpath  [[[<drive>:]<path>]<answer.xml>] [-resultpath <result.xml> [-restart] | -whatif] [-logpath [[<drive>:]<path>]<log.txt>]
servermanagercmd -install <id> [-allSubFeatures] [-resultpath [[<drive>:]<path>]<result.xml> [-restart] | -whatif] [-logpath [[<Drive>:]<path>]<log.txt>]
servermanagercmd -remove <id> [-resultpath <result.xml> [-restart] | -whatif] [-logpath  [[<drive>:]<path>]<log.txt>]
servermanagercmd [-help | -?]

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| -query `[[[<drive>:]<path>]<query.xml>]` | Displays a list of all roles, role services, and features installed and available for installation on the server. You can also use the short form of this parameter, **-q**. If you want the query results saved to an XML file, specify an XML file to replace `<query.xml>`. |
| -inputpath  `[[[<drive>:]<path>]<answer.xml>]` | Installs or removes the roles, role services, and features specified in an XML answer file represented by `<answer.xml>`. You can also use the short form of this parameter, **-p.** |
| -install `<id>` | Installs the role, role service, or feature specified by `<id>`. The identifiers are case-insensitive. Multiple roles, role services, and features must be separated by spaces. The following optional parameters are used with the **-install** parameter:<ul><li>**-setting** `<SettingName>=<SettingValue>` - Specifies required settings for the installation.</li><li>**-allSubFeatures** - Specifies the installation of all subordinate services and features along with the parent role, role service, or feature named in the `<id>` value.<p>**NOTE**<br>Some role containers do not have a command line identifier to allow installation of all role services. This is the case when role services cannot be installed in the same instance of the Server Manager command. For example, the Federation Service role service of active directory Federation Services and the Federation Service Proxy role service cannot be installed by using the same Server Manager command instance.</li><li>**-resultpath** `<result.xml>` - Saves installation results to an XML file represented by `<result.xml>`. You can also use the short form of this parameter, **-r**.<p>**NOTE**<br>You can't run servermanagercmd with both the **-resultpath** parameter and the **-whatif** parameter specified.</li><li>**-restart** - Restarts the computer automatically when installation is complete (if restarting is required by the roles or features installed).</li><li>**-whatif** - Displays any operations specified for the **-install** parameter. You can also use the short form of the **-whatif** parameter, **-w**. You can't run **servermanagercmd** with both the **-resultpath** parameter and the **-whatif** parameter specified.</li><li>**-logpath** `<[[<drive>:]<path>]<log.txt>>` - Specifies a name and location for the log file, other than the default, `%windir%\temp\servermanager.log`.</li></ul> |
| -remove `<id>` | Removes the role, role service, or feature specified by `<id>`. The identifiers are case-insensitive. Multiple roles, role services, and features must be separated by spaces. The following optional parameters are used with the **-remove** parameter:<ul><li>**-resultpath** `<[[<drive>:]<path>]result.xml>` - Saves removal results to an XML file represented by `<result.xml>`. You can also use the short form of this parameter, **-r**.<p>**NOTE**<br>You can't run servermanagercmd with both the **-resultpath** and the **-whatif** parameters specified.</li><li>**-restart** - Restarts the computer automatically when removal is complete (if restarting is required by remaining roles or features).</li><li>**-whatif** - Displays any operations specified for the -remove parameter. You can also use the short form of the -whatif parameter, **-w**. You can't run servermanagercmd with both the **-resultpath** and the **-whatif** parameters specified.</li><li>**-logpath**`<[[<Drive>:]<path>]<log.txt>>` - Specifies a name and location for the log file, other than the default, `%windir%\temp\servermanager.log`.</li></ul> |
