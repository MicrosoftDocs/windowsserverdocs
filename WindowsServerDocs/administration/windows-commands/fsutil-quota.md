> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8

Manages disk quotas on NTFS volumes to provide more precise control of network-based storage.

## Syntax

```
fsutil quota [disable] <volumepath>
fsutil quota [enforce] <volumepath>
fsutil quota [modify] <volumepath> <threshold> <limit> <username>
fsutil quota [query] <volumepath>
fsutil quota [track] <volumepath>
fsutil quota [violations]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| disable | Disables quota tracking and enforcement on the specified volume. |
| enforce | Enforces quota usage on the specified volume. |
| modify | Modifies an existing disk quota or creates a new quota. |
| query | Lists existing disk quotas. |
| track | Tracks disk usage on the specified volume. |
| violations | Searches the system and application logs and displays a message to indicate that quota violations have been detected or that a user has reached a quota threshold or quota limit. |
| `<volumepath>` | Required. Specifies the drive name followed by a colon or the GUID in the format `volume{GUID}`. |
| `<threshold>`  | Sets the limit (in bytes) at which warnings are issued. This parameter is required for the `fsutil quota modify` command. |
| `<limit>` | Sets the maximum allowed disk usage (in bytes). This parameter is required for the `fsutil quota modify` command. |
| `<username>` | Specifies the domain or user name. This parameter is required for the `fsutil quota modify` command. |

#### Remarks

- Disk quotas are implemented on a per-volume basis, and they enable both hard and soft storage limits to be implemented on a per-user basis.

- You can use write scripts that use **fsutil quota** to set the quota limits every time you add a new user or to automatically track quota limits, compile them into a report, and automatically send them to the system administrator in e-mail.

### Examples

To list existing disk quotas for a disk volume that is specified with the GUID, {928842df-5a01-11de-a85c-806e6f6e6963}, type:

```
fsutil quota query volume{928842df-5a01-11de-a85c-806e6f6e6963}
```

To list existing disk quotas for a disk volume that is specified with the drive letter, **C:**, type:

```
fsutil quota query C:
```
