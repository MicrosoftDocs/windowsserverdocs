# time

Displays or sets the system time. If used without parameters, **time** displays the current system time and prompts you to enter a new time.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be an administrator to change the current time.

## Syntax

```
time [/t | [<HH>[:<MM>[:<SS>]] [am|pm]]]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| `<HH>[:<MM>[:<SS>[.<NN>]]] [am | pm]` | Sets the system time to the new time specified, where *HH* is in hours (required), *MM* is in minutes, and *SS* is in seconds. *NN* can be used to specify hundredths of a second. You must separate values for *HH*, *MM*, and *SS* with colons (:). *SS* and *NN* must be separated with a period (.).<p>If **am** or **pm** isn't specified, **time** uses the 24-hour format by default. |
| /t | Displays the current time without prompting you for a new time. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

#### Remarks

- Valid *HH* values are 0 through 24.

- Valid *MM* and *SS* values are 0 through 59.

## Examples

If command extensions are enabled, to display the current system time, type:

```
