# reset

Resets DiskShadow.exe to the default state. This command is especially useful in separating compound DiskShadow operations, such as **create**, **import**, **backup**, or **restore**.

> [!IMPORTANT
> After you run this command, you will lose state information from commands, such as **add**, **set**, **load**, or **writer**. This command also releases IVssBackupComponent interfaces and loses non-persistent shadow copies.
