# ftp binary

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Sets the file transfer type to binary. The **ftp** command supports both ASCII (default) and binary image file transfer types, but we recommend using binary when transferring executable files. In binary mode, files are transferred in one-byte units.

## Syntax

```
binary
```

### Examples

To set the file transfer type to binary, type:

```
binary
```
