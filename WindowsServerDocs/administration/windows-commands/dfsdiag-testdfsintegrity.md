# dfsdiag testdfsintegrity

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Checks the integrity of the Distributed File System (DFS) namespace by performing the following tests:

- Checks for DFS metadata corruption or inconsistencies between domain controllers.

- Validates the configuration of access-based enumeration to ensure that it is consistent between DFS metadata and the namespace server share.

- Detects overlapping DFS folders (links), duplicate folders, and folders with overlapping folder targets.

## Syntax

```
dfsdiag /testdfsintegrity /DFSroot: <DFS root path> [/recurse] [/full]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| /DFSroot: `<DFS root path>` | The DFS namespace to diagnose. |
| /recurse | Performs the testing, including any namespace interlinks. |
| /full | Verifies the consistency of the share and NTFS ACLs, along with the client side configuration on all folder targets. It also verifies that the online property is set. |

## Examples

To verify the integrity and consistency of the Distributed File System (DFS) namespaces in *contoso.com\MyNamespace*, including any interlinks, type:

```
dfsdiag /testdfsintegrity /DFSRoot:\contoso.com\MyNamespace /recurse /full
```
