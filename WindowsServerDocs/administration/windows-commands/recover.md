# recover



Recovers readable information from a bad or defective disk.

For examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).

## Syntax

```
recover [<Drive>:][<Path>]<FileName>
```

## Parameters

|           Parameter           |                                          Description                                          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [\<Drive>:][<Path>]<FileName> | Specifies the location and name of the file that you want to recover. *FileName* is required. |
|              /?               |                             Displays help at the command prompt.                              |

## Remarks

-   The **recover** command reads a file, sector-by-sector, and recovers data from the good sectors. Data in bad sectors is lost.
-   Bad sectors reported by **chkdsk** were marked as "bad" when your disk was prepared for operation. They pose no danger, and **recover** does not affect them.
-   Because all data in bad sectors is lost when you recover a file, you should recover only one file at a time.
-   You cannot use wildcard characters (**&#42;** and **?**) with the **recover** command. You must specify a file (and the location of the file if it is not in the current directory).

## <a name="BKMK_examples"></a>Examples

To recover the file Story.txt in the \Fiction directory on drive D, type:
```
recover d:\fiction\story.txt 
```
