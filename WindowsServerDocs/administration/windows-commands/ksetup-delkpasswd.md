# ksetup delkpasswd

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Removes a Kerberos password server (kpasswd) for a realm.

## Syntax

```
ksetup /delkpasswd <realmname> <kpasswdname>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `<realmname>` |  Specifies the uppercase DNS name, such as CORP.CONTOSO.COM, and is listed as the default realm or **Realm=** when **ksetup** is run. |
| `<kpasswdname>` | Specifies the Kerberos password server. It's stated as a case-insensitive, fully-qualified domain name, such as mitkdc.contoso.com. If the KDC name is omitted, DNS might be used to locate KDCs. |

### Examples

To make sure the realm CORP.CONTOSO.COM uses the non-Windows KDC server mitkdc.contoso.com as the password server, type:

```
ksetup /delkpasswd CORP.CONTOSO.COM mitkdc.contoso.com
```

To make sure the realm CORP.CONTOSO.COM is not mapped to a Kerberos password server (the KDC name), type `ksetup` on the Windows computer and then view the output.
