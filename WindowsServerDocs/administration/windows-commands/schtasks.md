# schtasks commands

Schedules commands and programs to run periodically or at a specific time, adds and removes tasks from the schedule, starts and stops tasks on demand, and displays and changes scheduled tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> The **schtasks.exe** tool performs the same operations as **Scheduled Tasks** in **Control Panel**. You can use these tools together and interchangeably.

## Required permissions

- To schedule, view, and change all tasks on the local computer, you must be a member of the Administrators group.

- To schedule, view, and change all tasks on the remote computer, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the remote computer, or you must use the **/u** parameter to provide the credentials of an Administrator of the remote computer.

- You can use the **/u** parameter in a **/create** or **/change** operation if the local and remote computers are in the same domain, or if the local computer is in a domain that the remote computer domain trusts. Otherwise, the remote computer can't authenticate the user account specified, and it can't verify that the account is a member of the Administrators group.

- The task you plan to run must have the appropriate permission; these permissions vary by task. By default, tasks run with the permissions of the current user of the local computer, or with the permissions of the user specified by the **/u** parameter, if one is included. o run a task with permissions of a different user account or with system permissions, use the **/ru** parameter.

## Syntax

```
schtasks change
schtasks create
schtasks delete
schtasks end
schtasks query
schtasks run
```
