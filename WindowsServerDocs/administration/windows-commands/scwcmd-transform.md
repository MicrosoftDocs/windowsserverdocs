# scwcmd transform

>Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2012

Transforms a security policy file generated by using the Security Configuration Wizard (SCW) into a new Group Policy Object (GPO) in Active Directory Domain Services. The transform operation does not change any settings on the server where it is performed. After the transform operation has completed, an administrator must link the GPO to the desired OUs to deploy the policy to servers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Domain administrator credentials are needed to complete the transform operation.
>
> Internet Information Services (IIS) security policy settings can't be deployed by using Group Policy.
>
> Firewall policies that list approved apps shouldn't be deployed to servers unless the Windows Firewall service started automatically when the server was last started.
