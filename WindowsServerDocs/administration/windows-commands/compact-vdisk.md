# compact vdisk

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Reduces the physical size of a dynamically expanding virtual hard disk (VHD) file. This parameter is useful because dynamically expanding VHDs increase in size as you add files, but they do not automatically reduce in size when you delete files.

## Syntax

```
compact vdisk
```

### Remarks

- A dynamically expanding VHD must be selected for this operation to succeed. Use the [select vdisk command](select-vdisk.md) to select a VHD and shift the focus to it.

- You can only use compact dynamically expanding VHDs that are detached or attached as read-only.
