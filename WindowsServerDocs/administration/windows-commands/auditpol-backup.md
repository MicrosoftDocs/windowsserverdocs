# auditpol backup

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Backs up system audit policy settings, per-user audit policy settings for all users, and all auditing options to a comma-separated value (CSV) text file.

To perform *backup* operations on the *per-user* and *system* policies, you must have **Write** or **Full Control** permission for that object set in the security descriptor. You can also perform *backup* operations if you have the **Manage auditing and security log** (SeSecurityPrivilege) user right. However, this right allows additional access that is not necessary to perform the overall *backup* operations.

## Syntax

```
auditpol /backup /file:<filename>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|------------- |
| /file | Specifies the name of the file to which the audit policy will be backed up. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

## Examples

To back up per-user audit policy settings for all users, system audit policy settings, and all auditing options into a CSV-formatted text file named auditpolicy.csv, type:

```
auditpol /backup /file:C:\auditpolicy.csv
```

> [!NOTE]
> If no drive is specified, the current directory is used.
