# bdehdcfg

Prepares a hard drive with the partitions necessary for BitLocker Drive Encryption. Most installations of Windows 7 will not need to use this tool because BitLocker setup includes the ability to prepare and repartition drives as required.

> [!WARNING]
> There is a known conflict with the **Deny write access to fixed drives not protected by BitLocker** Group Policy setting located in **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Fixed Data Drives**.
>
>If bdehdcfg is run on a computer when this policy setting is enabled, you may encounter the following issues:
>
>- If you attempted to shrink the drive and create the system drive, the drive size will be successfully reduced and a raw partition will be created. However, the raw partition will not be formatted. The following error message is displayed: The new active Drive cannot be formatted. You may need to manually prepare your drive for BitLocker.
>
>- If you attempted to use unallocated space to create the system drive, a raw partition will be created. However, the raw partition will not be formatted. The following error message is displayed: The new active Drive cannot be formatted. You may need to manually prepare your drive for BitLocker.
>
>- If you attempted to merge an existing drive into the system drive, the tool will fail to copy the required boot file onto the target drive to create the system drive. The following error message is displayed: BitLocker setup failed to copy boot files. You may need to manually prepare your drive for BitLocker.
>
>- If this policy setting is being enforced, a hard drive cannot be repartitioned because the drive is protected. If you are upgrading computers in your organization from a previous version of Windows and those computers were configured with a single partition, you should create the required BitLocker system partition before applying the policy setting to the computers.
