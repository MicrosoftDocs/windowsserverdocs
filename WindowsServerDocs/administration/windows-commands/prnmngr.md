If you do not specify a server, Windows deletes all printers on the local computer.                                                                                                               |

If you do not specify a server, Windows lists the printers installed on the local computer.                                                                                                         |

Can be used with the **-a** and **-x** parameters.                                                                                                                                      |

If you do not specify a computer, the local computer is used.                                                                                                                  |

Drivers are often named for the model of printer they support. See the printer documentation for more information.                                                                                                           |

If this is a parallel or a serial port, use the ID of the port (for example, LPT1: or COM1:). If this is a TCP/IP port, use the port name that was specified when the port was added.                                                                          |
| -u \<UserName> -w \<Password> | Specifies an account with permissions to connect to the computer that hosts the printer that you want to manage. All members of the target computer's local Administrators group have these permissions, but the permissions can also be granted to other users. If you do not specify an account, you must be logged on under an account with these permissions for the command to work. |
|              /?               |                                                                                                                                                                           Displays help at the command prompt.                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Remarks
-   The **prndrvr** command is a Visual Basic script located in the %WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\\<language> directory. To use this command, at a command prompt, type **cscript** followed by the full path to the **prnmngr** file, or change directories to the appropriate folder. For example:
    ```
    cscript %WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\prnmngr
    ```
-   if the information that you supply contains spaces, use quotation marks around the text (for example, `"computer Name"`).

## <a name="BKMK_examples"></a>Examples
To add a printer named colorprinter_2 that is connected to LPT1 on the local computer and requires a printer driver called color printer Driver1, type:
```
cscript prnmngr -a -p colorprinter_2 -m "color printer Driver1" -r lpt1:
```
To delete the printer named colorprinter_2 from the remote computer named HRServer, type:
```
cscript prnmngr -d -s HRServer -p colorprinter_2 
```
