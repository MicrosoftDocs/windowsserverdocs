# bitsadmin setnoprogresstimeout

Sets the length of time, in seconds, that BITS tries to transfer the file after the first transient error occurs.

## Syntax

```
bitsadmin /setnoprogresstimeout <job> <timeoutvalue>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| job | The job's display name or GUID. |
| timeoutvalue | The length of time that BITS waits to transfer a file after the first error, in seconds. |

### Remarks

- The "no progress" timeout interval begins when the job encounters its first transient error.

- The timeout interval stops or resets when a byte of data is successfully transferred.

- If the "no progress" timeout interval exceeds the *timeoutvalue*, then the job is placed in a fatal error state.

## Examples

To set the "no progress" timeout value to 20 seconds, for the job named *myDownloadJob*:

```
bitsadmin /setnoprogresstimeout myDownloadJob 20
```
