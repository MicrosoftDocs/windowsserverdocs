# findstr

Searches for patterns of text in files.

For examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#examples).

## Syntax

```
findstr [/b] [/e] [/l | /r] [/s] [/i] [/x] [/v] [/n] [/m] [/o] [/p] [/f:<File>] [/c:<String>] [/g:<File>] [/d:<DirList>] [/a:<ColorAttribute>] [/off[line]] <Strings> [<Drive>:][<Path>]<FileName>[ ...]
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|/b|Matches the text pattern if it is at the beginning of a line.|
|/e|Matches the text pattern if it is at the end of a line.|
|/l|Processes search strings literally.|
|/r|Processes search strings as regular expressions. This is the default setting.|
|/s|Searches the current directory and all subdirectories.|
|/i|Ignores the case of the characters when searching for the string.|
|/x|Prints lines that match exactly.|
|/v|Prints only lines that do not contain a match.|
|/n|Prints the line number of each line that matches.|
|/m|Prints only the file name if a file contains a match.|
|/o|Prints character offset before each matching line.|
|/p|Skips files with non-printable characters.|
|/off[line]|Does not skip files that have the offline attribute set.|
|/f:\<File>|Gets a file list from the specified file.|
|/c:\<String>|Uses the specified text as a literal search string.|
|/g:\<File>|Gets search strings from the specified file.|
|/d:\<DirList>|Searches the specified list of directories. Each directory must be separated with a semicolon (;), for example `dir1;dir2;dir3`.|
|/a:\<ColorAttribute>|Specifies color attributes with two hexadecimal digits. Type `color /?` for additional information.|
|\<Strings>|Specifies the text to search for in *FileName*. Required.|
|[\<Drive>:][<Path>]<FileName>[ ...]|Specifies the location and file or files to search. At least one file name is required.|
|/?|Displays Help at the command prompt.|

## Remarks

- All **findstr** command-line options must precede *Strings* and *FileName* in the command string.
- Regular expressions use both literal characters and metacharacters to find patterns of text, rather than exact strings of characters. A literal character is a character that does not have a special meaning in the regular-expression syntaxâ€”it matches an occurrence of that character. For example, letters and numbers are literal characters. A metacharacter is a symbol with special meaning (an operator or delimiter) in the regular-expression syntax.

  The following table lists the metacharacters that **findstr** accepts.  

  |Metacharacter|Value|
  |-------------|-----|
  |.|Wildcard: any character|
  |*|Repeat: zero or more occurrences of the previous character or class|
  |^|Line position: beginning of the line|
  |$|Line position: end of the line|
  |[class]|Character class: any one character in a set|
  |[^class]|Inverse class: any one character not in a set|
  |[x-y]|Range: any characters within the specified range|
  |\x|Escape: literal use of a metacharacter x|
  |\\<string|Word position: beginning of the word|
  |string\>|Word position: end of the word|

  The special characters in regular expression syntax have the most power when you use them together. For example, use the following combination of the wildcard character (.) and repeat (*) character to match any string of characters:

  ```
  .*
  ``` 

  Use the following expression as part of a larger expression to match any string beginning with "b" and ending with "ing": 

  ```
  b.*ing
  ```

## Examples

Use spaces to separate multiple search strings unless the argument is prefixed with **/c**.

To search for "hello" or "there" in file x.y, type:

```
findstr "hello there" x.y 
```

To search for "hello there" in file x.y, type:

```
findstr /c:"hello there" x.y 
```

To find all occurrences of the word "Windows" (with an initial capital letter W) in the file Proposal.txt, type:

```
findstr Windows proposal.txt 
```

To search every file in the current directory and all subdirectories that contained the word Windows, regardless of the letter case, type:

```
findstr /s /i Windows *.* 
```

To find all occurrences of lines that begin with "FOR" and are preceded by zero or more spaces (as in a computer program loop), and to display the line number where each occurrence is found, type:

```
findstr /b /n /r /c:"^ *FOR" *.bas 
```

To search for multiple strings in a set of files, create a text file that contains each search criterion on a separate line. You can also list the exact files that you want to search in a text file. For example, to use the search criteria in the file Stringlist.txt, search the files listed in Filelist.txt, and then store the results in the file Results.out, type:

```
findstr /g:stringlist.txt /f:filelist.txt > results.out 
```

To list every file containing the word "computer" within the current directory and all subdirectories, regardless of case, type:

```
findstr /s /i /m "\<computer\>" *.*
```

To list every file containing the word "computer" and any other words that begin with "comp", (such as "compliment" and "compete"), type:

```
findstr /s /i /m "\<comp.*" *.*
```
