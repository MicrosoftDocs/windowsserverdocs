# chcp

Changes the active console code page. If used without parameters, **chcp** displays the number of the active console code page.

## Syntax

```
chcp [<nnn>]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `<nnn>` | Specifies the code page. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

The following table lists each supported code page and its country/region or language:

| Code page | Country/region or language |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| 437 | United States |
| 850 | Multilingual (Latin I) |
| 852 | Slavic (Latin II) |
| 855 | Cyrillic (Russian) |
| 857 | Turkish |
| 860 | Portuguese |
| 861 | Icelandic |
| 863 | Canadian-French |
| 865 | Nordic |
| 866 | Russian |
| 869 | Modern Greek |
| 936 | Chinese |

#### Remarks

- Only the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code page that is installed with Windows appears correctly in a Command Prompt window that uses Raster fonts. Other code pages appear correctly in full-screen mode or in Command Prompt windows that use TrueType fonts.

- You don't need to prepare code pages (as in MS-DOS).

- Programs that you start after you assign a new code page use the new code page. However, programs (except Cmd.exe) that you started before assigning the new code page will continue to use the original code page.

## Examples

To view the active code page setting, type:

```
chcp
```

A message similar to the following appears: `Active code page: 437`

To change the active code page to 850 (Multilingual), type:

```
chcp 850
```

If the specified code page is invalid, the following error message appears: `Invalid code page`
