## Syntax

```
change port [<portX>=<portY| /d <portX | /query]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| <portX>=<portY> | Maps COM `<*portX*>` to `<*portY*>` |
| /d <portX> | Deletes the mapping for COM `<*portX*>` |
| /query | Displays the current port mappings. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

#### Remarks

- Most MS-DOS applications support only COM1 through COM4 serial ports. The **change port** command maps a serial port to a different port number, allowing apps that don't support high-numbered COM ports to access the serial port. Remapping works only for the current session and is not retained if you log off from a session and then log on again.

- Use **change port** without any parameters to display the available COM ports and their current mappings.

## Examples

- To map COM12 to COM1 for use by an MS-DOS-based application, type:

  ```
  change port com12=com1
  ```

- To display the current port mappings, type:

  ```
  change port /query
  ```
