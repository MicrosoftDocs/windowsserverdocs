# msiexec

Provides the means to install, modify, and perform operations on Windows Installer from the command line.

## Install options

Set the install type for launching an installation package.

### Syntax

```
msiexec.exe [/i][/a][/j{u|m|/g|/t}][/x] <path_to_package>
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | -------- |
| /i | Specifies normal installation. |
| /a | Specifies administrative installation. |
| /ju | Advertise the product to the current user. |
| /jm | Advertise the product to all users. |
| /j/g | Specifies the language identifier used by the advertised package. |
| /j/t | Applies transform to the advertised package. |
| /x | Uninstalls the package. |
| `<path_to_package>` | Specifies the location and name of the installation package file. |

#### Examples

To install a package named *example.msi* from the C: drive, using a normal installation process, type:

```
msiexec.exe /i "C:\example.msi"
```

## Display options

You can configure what a user sees during the installation process, based on your target environment. For example, if you're distributing a package to all clients for manual installation, there should be a full UI. However, if you're deploying a package using Group Policy, which requires no user interaction, there should be no UI involved.

### Syntax

```
msiexec.exe /i <path_to_package> [/quiet][/passive][/q{n|b|r|f}]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | -------- |
| `<path_to_package>` | Specifies the location and name of the installation package file. |
| /quiet | Specifies quiet mode, which means there's no user interaction required. |
| /passive | Specifies unattended mode, which means the installation only shows a progress bar. |
| /qn | Specifies there's no UI during the installation process. |
| /qn+ | Specifies there's no UI during the installation process, except for a final dialog box at the end. |
| /qb | Specifies there's a basic UI during the installation process. |
| /qb+ | Specifies there's a basic UI during the installation process, including a final dialog box at the end. |
| /qr | Specifies a reduced UI experience during the installation process. |
| /qf | Specifies a full UI experience during the installation process. |

##### Remarks

- The modal box isn't shown if the installation is cancelled by the user. You can use **qb+!** or **qb!+** to hide the **CANCEL** button.

#### Examples

To install package *C:\example.msi*, using a normal installation process and no UI, type:

```
msiexec.exe /i "C:\example.msi" /qn
```

## Restart options

If your installation package overwrites files or attempts to change files that are in use, a reboot might be required before the installation completes.

### Syntax

```
msiexec.exe /i <path_to_package> [/norestart][/promptrestart][/forcerestart]
```

#### Parameters

| /forcerestart | Restarts the device after the installation completes. |

#### Examples

To install package *C:\example.msi*, using a normal installation process with no reboot at the end, type:

```

## Logging options

If you need to debug your installation package, you can set the parameters to create a log file with specific information.
