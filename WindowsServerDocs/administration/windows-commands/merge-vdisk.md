# merge vdisk

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Merges a differencing virtual hard disk (VHD) with its corresponding parent VHD. The parent VHD will be modified to include the modifications from the differencing VHD. This command modifies the parent VHD. As a result, other differencing VHDs that are dependent on the parent will no longer be valid.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must choose and detach a VHD for this operation to succeed. Use the **select vdisk** command to select a VHD and shift the focus to it.

## Syntax

```
merge vdisk depth=<n>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| depth=`<n>` | Indicates the number of parent VHD files to merge together. For example, `depth=1` indicates that the differencing VHD will be merged with one level of the differencing chain. |

### Examples

To merge a differencing VHD with its parent VHD, type:

```
merge vdisk depth=1
```
