### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| all | Specifies that each and every sector on the disk is set to zero, which completely deletes all data contained on the disk. |

#### Remarks

- On master boot record (MBR) disks, only the MBR partitioning information and hidden sector information is overwritten.

- On GUID Partition Table (gpt) disks, the gpt partitioning information, including the Protective MBR, is overwritten. There is no hidden sector information.

## Examples

To remove all formatting from the selected disk, type:

```
clean
```
