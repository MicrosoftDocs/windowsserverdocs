# setlocal

Starts localization of environment variables in a batch file. Localization continues until a matching **endlocal** command is encountered or the end of the batch file is reached.

## Syntax

```
setlocal [enableextensions | disableextensions] [enabledelayedexpansion | disabledelayedexpansion]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| enableextensions | Enables the command extensions until the matching **endlocal** command is encountered, regardless of the setting before the **setlocal** command was run. |
| disableextensions | Disables the command extensions until the matching **endlocal** command is encountered, regardless of the setting before the **setlocal** command was run. |
| enabledelayedexpansion | Enables the delayed environment variable expansion until the matching **endlocal** command is encountered, regardless of the setting before the **setlocal** command was run. |
| disabledelayedexpansion | Disables the delayed environment variable expansion until the matching **endlocal** command is encountered, regardless of the setting before the **setlocal** command was run. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

#### Remarks

- If you use **setlocal** outside of a script or batch file, it has no effect.

- Use **setlocal** to change environment variables when you run a batch file. Environment changes made after you run **setlocal** are local to the batch file. The Cmd.exe program restores previous settings when it encounters an **endlocal** command or reaches the end of the batch file.

- You can have more than one **setlocal** or **endlocal** command in a batch program (that is, nested commands).

- The **setlocal** command sets the ERRORLEVEL variable. If you pass {**enableextensions** | **disableextensions**} or {**enabledelayedexpansion** | **disabledelayedexpansion**}, the ERRORLEVEL variable is set to **0** (zero). Otherwise, it's set to **1**. You can use this information in batch scripts to determine whether the extensions are available, as shown in the following example:

    ```
    setlocal enableextensions
    verify other 2>nul
    if errorlevel 1 echo Unable to enable extensions
    ```

    Because **cmd** does not set the ERRORLEVEL variable when command extensions are disabled, the **verify** command initializes the ERRORLEVEL variable to a nonzero value when you use it with an invalid argument. Also, if you use the **setlocal** command with arguments {**enableextensions** | **disableextensions**} or {**enabledelayedexpansion** | **disabledelayedexpansion**} and it does not set the ERRORLEVEL variable to **1**, command extensions are not available.

## Examples

To localize environment variables in a batch file, follow this sample script:

```
rem *******Begin Comment**************
rem This program starts the superapp batch program on the network,
rem directs the output to a file, and displays the file
rem in Notepad.
rem *******End Comment**************
@echo off
setlocal
path=g:\programs\superapp;%path%
call superapp>c:\superapp.out
endlocal
start notepad c:\superapp.out
```
