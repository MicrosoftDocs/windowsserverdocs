# diskraid



DiskRAID is a command-line tool that enables you to configure and manage redundant array of independent (or inexpensive) disks (RAID) storage subsystems.

RAID is a method used to standardize and categorize fault-tolerant disk systems. RAID levels provide various mixes of performance, reliability, and cost. RAID is usually used on servers. Some servers provide three of the RAID levels: Level 0 (striping), Level 1 (mirroring), and Level 5 (striping with parity).

A hardware RAID subsystem distinguishes physically addressable storage units from one another by using a Logical Unit Number (LUN). A LUN object must have at least one plex, and can have any number of additional plexes. Each plex contains a copy of the data on the LUN object. Plexes can be added to and removed from a LUN object.

Most DiskRAID commands operate on a specific host bus adapter (HBA) port, initiator adapter, initiator portal, provider, subsystem, controller, port, drive, LUN, target portal, target, or target portal group. You use the SELECT command to select an object. The selected object is said to have focus. Focus simplifies common configuration tasks, such as creating multiple LUNs within the same subsystem.

> [!NOTE]
> The DiskRAID command-line tool works only with storage subsystems that support Virtual Disk Service (VDS).

**drives**=

Specifies the *drive_number* for the drives to use to create a LUN. If the **size=** parameter is not specified, the LUN created is the largest possible size allowed by all the specified drives. If the **size=** parameter is specified, providers will select drives from the specified drive list to create the LUN. Providers will attempt to use the drives in the order specified when possible.

**stripesize**=

Specifies the size in megabytes for a *stripe* or *RAID* LUN. The stripesize cannot be changed after the LUN is created.

To specify the size using other units, use one of the following recognized suffixes immediately after the size:
-   **B** for byte.
-   **KB** for kilobyte.
-   **MB** for megabyte.
-   **GB** for gigabyte.

Specifying an invalid initiator adapter index results in no in-focus initiator adapter. Selecting an initiator adapter deselects any selected HBA ports and initiator portals.

**iportal** [\<n>]

Sets the focus to the specified local iSCSI initiator portal within the selected iSCSI initiator adapter. If no initiator portal is specified, the command displays the currently selected initiator portal (if any). Specifying an invalid initiator portal index results in no selected initiator portal.

**provider** [\<n>]

Sets the focus to the specified provider. If no provider is specified, the command displays the currently selected provider (if any). Specifying an invalid provider index results in no in-focus provider.

**subsystem** [\<n>]

Sets the focus to the specified subsystem. If no subsystem is specified, the command displays the subsystem with focus (if any). Specifying an invalid subsystem index results in no in-focus subsystem. Selecting a subsystem implicitly selects its associated provider.

**controller** [\<n>]

Sets the focus to the specified controller within the currently selected subsystem. If no controller is specified, the command displays the currently selected controller (if any). Specifying an invalid controller index results in no in-focus controller. Selecting a controller deselects any selected controller ports, drives, LUNs, target portals, targets, and target portal groups.

**port** [\<n>]

Sets the focus to the specified controller port within the currently selected controller. If no port is specified, the command displays the currently selected port (if any). Specifying an invalid port index results in no selected port.

**drive** [\<n>]

Sets the focus to the specified drive, or physical spindle, within the currently selected subsystem. If no drive is specified, the command displays the currently selected drive (if any). Specifying an invalid drive index results in no in-focus drive. Selecting a drive deselects any selected controllers, controller ports, LUNs, target portals, targets, and target portal groups.

**lun** [\<n>]

Sets the focus to the specified LUN within the currently selected subsystem. If no LUN is specified, the command displays the currently selected LUN (if any). Specifying an invalid LUN index results in no selected LUN. Selecting a LUN deselects any selected controllers, controller ports, drives, target portals, targets, and target portal groups.

**tportal** [\<n>]

Sets the focus to the specified iSCSI target portal within the currently selected subsystem. If no target portal is specified, the command displays the currently selected target portal (if any). Specifying an invalid target portal index results in no selected target portal. Selecting a target portal deselects any controllers, controller ports, drives, LUNs, targets, and target portal groups.

**target** [\<n>]

Sets the focus to the specified iSCSI target within the currently selected subsystem. If no target is specified, the command displays the currently selected target (if any). Specifying an invalid target index results in no selected target. Selecting a target deselects any controllers, controller ports, drives, LUNs, target portals, and target portal groups.

**tpgroup** [\<n>]

Sets the focus to the specified iSCSI target portal group within the currently selected iSCSI target. If no target portal group is specified, the command displays the currently selected target portal group (if any). Specifying an invalid target portal group index results in no in-focus target portal group.

[\<n>]

Specifies the \<object number> to select. If the <object number> specified is not valid, any existing selections for objects of the specified type are cleared. If no <object number> is specified, the current object is displayed.

### <a name="BKMK_34"></a>setflag

Sets the currently selected drive as a hot spare.

#### Syntax

```
setflag drive hotspare={true | false}
```

#### Parameters

**true**

Selects the currently selected drive as a hot spare.

**false**

Unselects the currently selected drive as a hot spare.

#### Remarks

Hot spares cannot be used for ordinary LUN binding operations. They are reserved for fault handling only. The drive must not be currently bound to any existing LUN.

### <a name="BKMK_shrink"></a>shrink

Reduces the size of the selected LUN.

#### Syntax

```
shrink lun size=<n> [noerr]
```

#### Parameters

**size=**

Specifies the desired amount of space in megabytes (MB) to reduce the size of the LUN by. To specify the size using other units, use one of the recognized suffixes (B, KB, MB, GB, TB and PB) immediately after the size.

**noerr**

Specifies that any failures that occur while performing this operation will be ignored. This is useful in script mode.

### <a name="BKMK_35"></a>standby

Changes the status of the paths to the currently selected host bus adapter (HBA) port to STANDBY.

#### Syntax

```
standby hbaport
```

#### Parameters

**hbaport**

Changes the status of the paths to the currently selected host bus adapter (HBA) port to STANDBY.

### <a name="BKMK_36"></a>unmask

Makes the currently selected LUNs accessible from the specified hosts.

#### Syntax

```
unmask LUN {all | none | [add] wwn=<hexadecimal_number> [;<hexadecimal_number> [;…]] | [add] initiator=<initiator>[;<initiator>[;…]]} [uninstall]
```

#### Parameters

**all**

Specifies that the LUN should be made accessible from all hosts. However, you cannot unmask the LUN to all targets in an iSCSI subsystem.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must logout of the target before you run the UNMASK ALL command.

**none**

Specifies that the LUN should not be accessible to any host.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must logout of the target before you run the UNMASK LUN NONE command.

**add**

Specifies that the hosts specified must be added to the existing list of hosts that this LUN is accessible from. If this parameter is not specified, the list of hosts supplied replaces the existing list of hosts that this LUN is accessible from.

**WWN=**

Specifies a list of hexadecimal numbers representing world-wide names from which the LUN or hosts should be made accessible. To mask/unmask to a specific set of hosts in a Fibre Channel subsystem, you can type a semicolon-separated list of WWN's for the ports on the host machines of interest.

**initiator=**

Specifies a list of iSCSI initiators to which the currently selected LUN should be made accessible. To mask/unmask to a specific set of hosts in an iSCSI subsystem, you can type a semicolon-separated list of iSCSI initiator names for the initiators on the host computers of interest.

**uninstall**

If specified, uninstalls the disk associated with the LUN on the local system before the LUN is masked.

## Scripting DiskRAID

DiskRAID can be scripted on any computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 with an associated VDS hardware provider. To invoke a DiskRAID script, at the command prompt type:
```
diskraid /s <script.txt>
```
By default, DiskRAID stops processing commands and returns an error code if there is a problem in the script. To continue running the script and ignore errors, include the NOERR parameter on the command. This permits such useful practices as using a single script to delete all the LUNs in a subsystem regardless of the total number of LUNs. Not all commands support the NOERR parameter. Errors are always returned on command-syntax errors, regardless of whether you included the NOERR parameter,

### DiskRAID error codes

|Error Code|Error Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|0|No error occurred. The entire script ran without failure.|
|1|A fatal exception occurred.|
|2|The arguments specified on a DiskRAID command line were incorrect.|
|3|DiskRAID was unable to open the specified script or output file.|
|4|One of the services DiskRAID uses returned a failure.|
|5|A command syntax error occurred. The script failed because an object was improperly selected or was invalid for use with that command.|

## Example: Interactively View Status of Subsystem

If you want to view the status of subsystem 0 on your computer, type the following at the command line:
```
diskraid
```
Press ENTER. The following is displayed:
```
Microsoft Diskraid version 5.2.xxxx
Copyright (©) 2003 Microsoft Corporation
On computer: COMPUTER_NAME
```
To select subsystem 0, type the following at the DiskRAID prompt:
```
select subsystem 0
```
Press ENTER. Output similar to the following is displayed:
```
Subsystem 0 is now the selected subsystem.
