# rsh



Runs commands on remote computers running the RSH service or daemon. This command has been deprecated. You can install the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications using the Add Features Wizard. For more information, see [Windows Server 2008 UNIX Interoperability Components](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=191835) at the Microsoft Web site. After installation, you can then open a C Shell or Korn Shell command window and run **rsh**. For more information, type **man rsh** at the C Shell or Korn Shell prompt.
