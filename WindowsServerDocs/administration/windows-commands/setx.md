# setx



Creates or modifies environment variables in the user or system environment, without requiring programming or scripting. The **Setx** command also retrieves the values of registry keys and writes them to text files.

For examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).

## Syntax

```
setx [/s <Computer> [/u [<Domain>\]<User name> [/p [<Password>]]]] <Variable> <Value> [/m]
setx [/s <Computer> [/u [<Domain>\]<User name> [/p [<Password>]]]] [<Variable>] /k <Path> [/m]
setx [/s <Computer> [/u [<Domain>\]<User name> [/p [<Password>]]]] /f <FileName> {[<Variable>] {/a <X>,<Y> | /r <X>,<Y> "<String>"} [/m] | /x} [/d <Delimiters>]
```

## Parameters

## Remarks

-   The **Setx** command is similar to the UNIX utility SETENV.
-   **Setx** provides the only command-line or programmatic way to directly and permanently set system environment values. System environment variables are manually configurable through **Control Panel** or through a registry editor. The **set** command, which is internal to the command interpreter (Cmd.exe), sets user environment variables for the current console window only.
-   You can use the **setx** command to set values for user and system environment variables from one of three sources (modes): Command Line Mode, Registry Mode, or File Mode.
-   **Setx** writes variables to the master environment in the registry. Variables set with **setx** variables are available in future command windows only, not in the current command window.
-   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER** and **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** are the only supported hives. REG_DWORD, REG_EXPAND_SZ, REG_SZ, and REG_MULTI_SZ are the valid **RegKey** data types.
-   When you gain access to **REG_MULTI_SZ** values in the registry, only the first item is extracted and used.
-   You cannot use the **setx** command to remove values that have been added to the local or system environments. You can use **set** with a variable name and no value to remove a corresponding value from the local environment.
-   REG_DWORD registry values are extracted and used in hexadecimal mode.
-   File mode supports the parsing of carriage return and line feed (CRLF) text files only.
