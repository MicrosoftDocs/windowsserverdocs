# Fsutil behavior

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7

Queries or sets NTFS volume behavior, which includes:

-   The creation of 8.3 character-length file names

-   Extended character use in 8.3 character-length short file names on NTFS volumes

-   The updating of the Last Access Time stamp when directories are listed on NTFS volumes

-   The frequency with which quota events are written to the system log and to NTFS paged pool and NTFS non-paged pool memory cache levels

-   The size of the master file table zone (MFT Zone)

-   Silent deletion of data when the system encounters corruption on an NTFS volume.

-   File-delete notification (also known as trim or unmap)

For examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).

## Syntax

```

fsutil behavior set {allowextchar {1|0} | bugcheckoncorrupt {1|0} | disable8dot3 [ <Value> | [<VolumePath> {1|0}] ] | disablecompression {1|0} | disablecompressionlimit {1|0} | disableencryption {1|0} | disablefilemetadataoptimization {1|0} | disablelastaccess {1|0} | disablespotcorruptionhandling {1|0} | disabletxf {1|0} | disablewriteautotiering {1|0} | encryptpagingfile {1|0} | mftzone <Value> | memoryusage <Value> | quotanotify <Frequency> | symlinkevaluation <SymbolicLinkType> | disabledeletenotify {1|0}}

## Parameters

|                 Parameter                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

When a compressed file reaches a certain level of fragmentation, rather than failing to extend the file, NTFS stops compressing additional extents of the file. This was done to allow compressed files to be larger than they normally would be. Setting this value to TRUE disables this feature which limits the size of compressed files on the system. We do not recommend disabling this feature.<br /><br />You must restart your computer for this parameter to take effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|            DisableDeleteNotify             | Disables \(**1**\) or enables \(**0**\) delete notifications. Delete notification \(also known as trim or unmap\) is a feature that notifies the underlying storage device of clusters that have been freed due to a file delete operation. In addition:<br /><br />-   For systems using ReFS v2, trim is disabled by default. Applies to Windows Server 2016.<br />- For systems using ReFS v1, trim is enabled by default. Applies to Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2016.<br />-  For systems using NTFS, trim is enabled by default unless an administrator disables it.<br />-  If your hard disk drive or SAN reports that it does not support trim, then your hard disk drive and SANs do not get trim notifications.<br />-   Enabling or disabling does not require a restart.<br />-   Trim is effective when the next unmap command is issued.<br />-   Existing inflight IO are not impacted by the registry change.<br />-   Does not require any service restart when you enable or disable trim.<br /><br />This parameter was introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7. |

## Remarks

-   The MFT Zone is a reserved area that enables the master file table (MFT) to expand as needed to prevent MFT fragmentation. If the average file size on the volume is 2 KB or less, it can be beneficial to set the **mftzone** value to 2. If the average file size on the volume is 1 KB or less, it can be beneficial to set the **mftzone** value to 4.

-   When **disable8dot3** is set to **0**, every time you create a file with a long file name, NTFS creates a second file entry that has an 8.3 character-length file name. When NTFS creates files in a directory, it must look up the 8.3 character-length file names that are associated with the long file names. This parameter updates the **HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation** registry key.

-   The **allowextchar** parameter updates the **HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\NtfsAllowExtendedCharacterIn8dot3Name** registry key.

-   The **disablelastaccess** parameter reduces the impact of logging updates to the Last Access Time stamp on files and directories. Disabling the **Last Access Time** feature improves the speed of file and directory access. This parameter updates the **HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate** registry key.

    Notes:

    -   File-based **Last Access Time** queries are accurate even if all on-disk values are not current. NTFS returns the correct value on queries because the accurate value is stored in memory.

    -   One hour is the maximum amount of time that NTFS defers updating **Last Access Time** on disk. If NTFS updates other file attributes such as **Last Modify Time**, and a **Last Access Time** update is pending, NTFS updates **Last Access Time** with the other updates without additional performance impact.

    -   The **disablelastaccess** parameter can affect programs such as Backup and Remote Storage that rely on this feature.

-   Increasing physical memory does not always increase the amount of paged pool memory available to NTFS. Setting **memoryusage** to **2** raises the limit of paged pool memory. This might improve performance if your system is opening and closing many files in the same file set and is not already using large amounts of system memory for other applications or for cache memory. If your computer is already using large amounts of system memory for other applications or for cache memory, increasing the limit of NTFS paged and non-paged pool memory reduces the available pool memory for other processes. This might reduce overall system performance. This parameter updates the **HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\NtfsMemoryUsage** registry key.

-   The value specified in the **mftzone** parameter is an approximation of the initial size of the MFT plus the MFT Zone on a new volume, and it is set at mount time for each file system. As space on the volume is used, NTFS adjusts the space reserved for future MFT growth. If the MFT Zone is already large, the full MFT Zone size is not reserved again. Because the MFT Zone is based on the contiguous range past the end of the MFT, it shrinks as the space is used.

    The file system does not determine the new MFT Zone location until the current MFT Zone is completely used. Note that this never occurs on a typical system.

-   Some devices may experience performance degradation when the delete notification feature is turned on. In this case, use the **disabledeletenotify** option to turn off the notification feature.

### <a name="BKMK_examples"></a>Examples
To query for the disable 8dot3 name behavior for a disk volume specified with the GUID, {928842df-5a01-11de-a85c-806e6f6e6963}, type:

```
fsutil behavior query disable8dot3 Volume{928842df-5a01-11de-a85c-806e6f6e6963}
```

You can also query the 8dot3 name behavior by using the **8dot3name** subcommand.

To query the system to see if TRIM is enabled or not, type:

```
fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify
```
This yields an output similar to this:

    NTFS DisableDeleteNotify = 1
    ReFS DisableDeleteNotify is not currently set

To override the default behavior for TRIM \(disabledeletenotify\) for ReFS v2, type:

```
fsutil behavior set DisableDeleteNotify ReFS 0
```

To override the default behavior for TRIM \(disabledeletenotify\) for NTFS and ReFS v1, type:
```
fsutil behavior set DisableDeleteNotify 1
```
