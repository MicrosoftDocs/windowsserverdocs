3. Add a system environment path variable to the folder you created in step 1.For example, **C:\Drivers\Video**.

4. Create the following registry key, and then for the **DriverPaths** key you create, set the **Value Data** to **1**.

5. For Windows® 7 navigate the registry path: **HKEY_LOCAL_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\\**, and then create the keys: **UnattendSettings\PnPUnattend\DriverPaths\\**
