# break

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This command is no longer in use. It is included only to preserve compatibility with existing MS-DOS files, but it has no effect at the command line because the functionality is automatic.

Sets or clears extended CTRL+C checking on MS-DOS systems. If used without parameters, **break** displays the existing setting value.

If command extensions are enabled and running on the Windows platform, inserting the **break** command into a batch file enters a hard-coded breakpoint if being debugged by a debugger.

## Syntax

```
break=[on|off]
```
