> ## Remarks
> - Only administrators can use the **change logon** command.
> - Logons are re-enabled when you restart the system. If you are connected to the Remote Desktop Session Host (rd Session Host) server from a client session and disable logons, and then log off before re-enabling logons, you will not be able to reconnect to your session. To re-enable logons from client sessions, log on at the console.
