> [!NOTE]
> To find out what's new in the latest version, see [What's New in Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn283323(v=ws.11)).

## Syntax

```
change logon {/query | /enable | /disable | /drain | /drainuntilrestart}
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| /query | Displays the current logon status, whether enabled or disabled. |
| /enable | Enables logons from client sessions, but not from the console. |
| /disable | Disables subsequent logons from client sessions, but not from the console. Does not affect currently logged on users. |
| /drain | Disables logons from new client sessions, but allows reconnections to existing sessions. |
| /drainuntilrestart | Disables logons from new client sessions until the computer is restarted, but allows reconnections to existing sessions. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

#### Remarks

- Logons are re-enabled when you restart the system.

- If you're connected to the Remote Desktop Session Host server from a client session, and then you disable logons and log off before re-enabling logons, you won't be able to reconnect to your session. To re-enable logons from client sessions, log on at the console.

### Examples

- To display the current logon status, type:

  ```
  change logon /query
  ```

- To enable logons from client sessions, type:

  ```
  change logon /enable
  ```

- To disable client logons, type:

  ```
  change logon /disable
  ```
