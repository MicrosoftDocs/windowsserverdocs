# autochk

Runs when the computer is started and prior to Windows Server starting to verify the logical integrity of a file system.

**Autochk.exe** is a version of **chkdsk** that runs only on NTFS disks and only before Windows Server starts. **autochk** cannot be run directly from the command-line. Instead, **autochk** runs in the following situations:

- If you try to run **chkdsk** on the boot volume.

- If **chkdsk** cannot gain exclusive use of the volume.

- If the volume is flagged as dirty.

## Remarks

> [!WARNING]
> The **autochk** command-line tool cannot be directly run from the command-line. Instead, use the **chkntfs** command-line tool to configure the way you want **autochk** to run at startup.
>
> - You can use **chkntfs** with the **/x** parameter to prevent **autochk** from running on a specific volume or multiple volumes.
>
> - Use the **chkntfs.exe** command-line tool with the **/t** parameter to change the autochk delay from 0 seconds to up to 3 days (259,200 seconds). However, a long delay means that the computer does not start until the time elapses or until you press a key to cancel **autochk**.
