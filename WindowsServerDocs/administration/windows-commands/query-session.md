## Remarks
-   A user can always query the session to which the user is currently logged on. To query other sessions, the user must have query Information special access permission.
-   if you do not specify a session by using <*SessionName*>, <*UserName*>, or <*SessionID*>, **query session** displays information about all active sessions in the system.
-   When **query session** returns information, a greater than (>) symbol is displayed before the current session. Following is sample output for **query session**:
    ```
    C:\>query session
     SESSIONNAME    USERNAME       ID STATE  TYPE   DEVICE
    >console        Administrator1  0 active wdcon
     rdp-tcp#1      User1           1 active wdtshare
     rdp-tcp                        2 listen wdtshare
                                    4 idle
                                    5 idle
    ```
    The greater than (>) symbol indicates the current session. SESSIONNAME specifies the name assigned to the session. USERNAME indicates the user name of the user connected to the session. STATE provides information about the current state of the session. TYPE indicates the session type. DEVICE, which is not present for the console or network-connected sessions, is the device name assigned to the session. The comment following session information is from the session profile. Any sessions in which the initial state is configured as DISABLED do not show up in the **query session** list until they are enabled.
