# nfsshare



You can use **nfsshare** to control Network File System (NFS) shares.

## Syntax

```
nfsshare <ShareName>=<Drive:Path> [-o <Option=value>...]
nfsshare {<ShareName> | <Drive>:<Path> | * } /delete
```

## Description

Without arguments, the **nfsshare** command-line utility lists all Network File System (NFS) shares exported by Server for NFS. With *ShareName* as the only argument, **nfsshare** lists the properties of the NFS share identified by *ShareName*. When *ShareName* and <em>Drive</em>**:**<em>Path</em> are provided, **nfsshare** exports the folder identified by <em>Drive</em>**:**<em>Path</em> as *ShareName*. When the **/delete** option is used, the specified folder is no longer made available to NFS clients.

## Options

The **nfsshare** command accepts the following options and arguments:

|  -o rw[=\<Host>[:<Host>]...]  |                       Provides read-write access to the shared directory by the hosts or client groups specified by *Host*. Separate host and group names with a colon (**:**). If *Host* is not specified, all hosts and client groups (except those specified with the **ro** option) have read-write access. If neither the **ro** nor the **rw** option is set, all clients have read-write access to the shared directory.                       |

If *Host* is not specified, all clients (except those specified with the **rw** option) have read-only access. If the **ro** option is set for one or more clients, but the **rw** option is not set, only the clients specified with the **ro** option have access to the shared directory. |

The default is -2. The anonymous GID will be used when reporting the owner of a file owned by an unmapped user, even if anonymous access is disabled.                                                                                      |

The default is -2. The anonymous UID will be used when reporting the owner of a file owned by an unmapped user, even if anonymous access is disabled.                                                                                      |

Separate host and group names with a colon (**:**). If *Host* is not specified, all clients have root access. If the **root** option is not set, no clients have root access to the shared directory.                                                                         |
