# reg commands

Performs operations on registry subkey information and values in registry entries.

Some operations enable you to view or configure registry entries on local or remote computers, while others allow you to configure only local computers. Using **reg** to configure the registry of remote computers limits the parameters that you can use in some operations. Check the syntax and parameters for each operation to verify that they can be used on remote computers.

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't edit the registry directly unless you have no alternative. The registry editor bypasses standard safeguards, allowing settings that can degrade performance, damage your system, or even require you to reinstall Windows. You can safely alter most registry settings by using the programs in Control Panel or Microsoft Management Console (MMC). If you must edit the registry directly, back it up first.

## Syntax

```
reg add
reg compare
reg copy
reg delete
