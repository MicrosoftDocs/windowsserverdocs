# wbadmin

Enables you to back up and restore your operating system, volumes, files, folders, and applications from a command prompt.

To configure a regularly scheduled backup using this command, you must be a member of the **Administrators** group. To perform all other tasks with this command, you must be a member of the **Backup Operators** group or the **Administrators** group, or you must have been delegated the appropriate permissions.

You must run **wbadmin** from an elevated command prompt, by right-clicking **Command Prompt**, and then selecting **Run as administrator**.
