# wbadmin get items

Lists the items included in a specific backup.

To list the items included in a specific backup using this command, you must be a member of the **Backup Operators** group or the **Administrators** group, or you must have been delegated the appropriate permissions. In addition, you must run **wbadmin** from an elevated command prompt, by right-clicking **Command Prompt**, and then selecting **Run as administrator**.

## Syntax

```
wbadmin get items -version:<VersionIdentifier> [-backupTarget:{<BackupDestinationVolume> | <NetworkSharePath>}] [-machine:<BackupMachineName>]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| -version | Specifies the version of the backup in MM/DD/YYYY-HH:MM format. If you don't know the version information, run the [wbadmin get versions](wbadmin-get-versions.md) command. |
| -backupTarget | Specifies the storage location that contains the backups for which you want the details. Use for listing backups stored at that target location. Backup target locations can be a locally attached disk drive or a remote shared folder. If this command is run on the same computer where the backup was created, this parameter isn't needed. However, this parameter is required to get information about a backup created from another computer. |
| -machine | Specifies the name of the computer that you want the backup details for. Useful when multiple computers have been backed up to the same location. Should be used when **-backupTarget** is specified. |

## Examples

To list items from the backup that was run on March 31, 2013 at 9:00 A.M., type:

```
wbadmin get items -version:03/31/2013-09:00
```

To list items from the backup of server01 that was run on April 30, 2013 at 9:00 A.M. and stored on `\\<servername>\<share>`, type:
