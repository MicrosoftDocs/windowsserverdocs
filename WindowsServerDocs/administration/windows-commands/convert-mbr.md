# convert mbr

Converts an empty basic disk with the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partition style into a basic disk with the master boot record (MBR) partition style. A basic disk must be selected for this operation to succeed. Use the [select disk command](select-disk.md) to select a basic disk and shift the focus to it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The disk must be empty to convert it to a basic disk. Back up your data, and then delete all partitions or volumes before converting the disk.

> [!NOTE]
> For instructions regarding how to use this command, see [Change a GUID Partition Table Disk into a Master Boot Record Disk](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-r2-and-2008/cc725797(v=ws.11)).

## Syntax

```
convert mbr [noerr]
```

### Parameters
