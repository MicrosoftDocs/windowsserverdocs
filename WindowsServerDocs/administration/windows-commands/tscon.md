## Syntax

tscon {<sessionID> | <sessionname>} [/dest:<sessionname>] [/password:<pw> | /password:*] [/v]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| `<sessionID>` | Specifies the ID of the session to which you want to connect. If you use the optional `/dest:<sessionname>` parameter, you can also specify the name of the current session. |
| `<sessionname>` | Specifies the name of the session to which you want to connect. |
| /dest:`<sessionname>` | Specifies the name of the current session. This session will disconnect when you connect to the new session. You can also use this parameter to connect the session of another user to a different session. |
| /password:`<pw>` | Specifies the password of the user who owns the session to which you want to connect. This password is required when the connecting user does not own the session. |

- You can't connect to the console session.
