```
### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|-------|--------|
|\<SessionID>|Specifies the ID of the session to which you want to connect. If you use the optional **/dest:**<*SessionName*> parameter, this is the ID of the session to which you want to connect.|
|\<SessionName>|Specifies the name of the session to which you want to connect.|
|/dest:\<SessionName>|Specifies the name of the current session. This session will disconnect when you connect to the new session.|
|/password:\<pw>|Specifies the password of the user who owns the session to which you want to connect. This password is required when the connecting user does not own the session.|
|/password:*|prompts for the password of the user who owns the session to which you want to connect.|
|/v|Displays information about the actions being performed.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

## Remarks
-   You must have Full Control access permission or Connect special access permission to connect to another session.
-   The **/dest:**<*SessionName*> parameter allows you to connect the session of another user to a different session.
-   if you do not specify a password in the <*Password*> parameter, and the target session belongs to a user other than the current one, **tscon** fails.
-   You cannot connect to the console session.

## Examples
- To connect to session 12 on the current rd Session Host server and disconnect the current session, type:
  ```
  tscon 12
  ```
- To connect to session 23 on the current rd Session Host server, by using the password mypass, and disconnect the current session, type:
  ```
  tscon 23 /password:mypass
  ```
- To connect the session named TERM03 to the session named TERM05, and then disconnect session TERM05, if it is connected, type:
  ```
  tscon TERM03 /v /dest:TERM05
  ```
