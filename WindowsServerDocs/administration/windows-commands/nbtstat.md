# nbtstat

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Displays NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) protocol statistics, NetBIOS name tables for both the local computer and remote computers, and the NetBIOS name cache. **nbtstat** allows a refresh of the NetBIOS name cache and the names registered with Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). Used without parameters, **nbtstat** displays help. 

## Syntax

```
nbtstat [/a <remoteName>] [/A <IPaddress>] [/c] [/n] [/r] [/R] [/RR] [/s] [/S] [<Interval>]
```

### Parameters

|    Parameter    |                                                                                                                         Description                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /a <remoteName> |    Displays the NetBIOS name table of a remote computer, where *remoteName* is the NetBIOS computer name of the remote computer. The NetBIOS name table is the list of NetBIOS names that corresponds to NetBIOS applications running on that computer.     |
| /A <IPaddress>  |                                                           Displays the NetBIOS name table of a remote computer, specified by the IP address (in dotted decimal notation) of the remote computer.                                                            |
|       /c        |                                                                        Displays the contents of the NetBIOS name cache, the table of NetBIOS names and their resolved IP addresses.                                                                         |
|       /n        |                                            Displays the NetBIOS name table of the local computer. The status of **registered** indicates that the name is registered either by broadcast or with a WINS server.                                             |
|       /r        |      Displays NetBIOS name resolution statistics. On a computer running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 that is configured to use WINS, this parameter returns the number of names that have been resolved and registered using broadcast and WINS.       |
|       /R        |                                                                      Purges the contents of the NetBIOS name cache and then reloads the #PRE-tagged entries from the **Lmhosts** file.                                                                      |
|       /RR       |                                                                           Releases and then refreshes NetBIOS names for the local computer that is registered with WINS servers.                                                                            |
|       /s        |                                                                          Displays NetBIOS client and server sessions, attempting to convert the destination IP address to a name.                                                                           |
|       /S        |                                                                          Displays NetBIOS client and server sessions, listing the remote computers by destination IP address only.                                                                          |
|   <Interval>    | Redisplays selected statistics, pausing the number of seconds specified in *Interval* between each display. Press CTRL+C to stop redisplaying statistics. If this parameter is omitted, **nbtstat** prints the current configuration information only once. |
|       /?        |                                                                                                            Displays help at the command prompt.                                                                                                             |

## Remarks

-   **nbtstat** command-line parameters are case-sensitive.

-   The following table describes the column headings that are generated by **nbtstat**:

    |Heading|Description|
    |------|--------|
    |Input|The number of bytes received.|
    |Output|The number of bytes sent.|
    |In/Out|Whether the connection is from the computer (outbound) or from another computer to the local computer (inbound).|
    |Life|The remaining time that a name table cache entry will live before it is purged.|
    |Local Name|The local NetBIOS name associated with the connection.|
    |remote Host|The name or IP address associated with the remote computer.|
    |<03>|The last byte of a NetBIOS name converted to hexadecimal. Each NetBIOS name is 16 characters long. This last byte often has special significance because the same name might be present several times on a computer, differing only in the last byte. For example, <20> is a space in ASCII text.|
    |type|The type of name. A name can either be a unique name or a group name.|
    |Status|Whether the NetBIOS service on the remote computer is running (registered) or a duplicate computer name has registered the same service (Conflict).|
    |State|The state of NetBIOS connections.|

-   The following table describes the possible NetBIOS connection states:

    |State|Description|
    |-----|--------|
    |Connected|A session has been established.|
    |associated|A connection endpoint has been created and associated with an IP address.|
    |listening|This endpoint is available for an inbound connection.|
    |Idle|This endpoint has been opened but cannot receive connections.|
    |Connecting|A session is in the connecting phase and the name-to-IP address mapping of the destination is being resolved.|
    |Accepting|An inbound session is currently being accepted and will be connected shortly.|
    |Reconnecting|A session is trying to reconnect (it failed to connect on the first attempt).|
    |Outbound|A session is in the connecting phase and the TCP connection is currently being created.|
    |Inbound|An inbound session is in the connecting phase.|
    |Disconnecting|A session is in the process of disconnecting.|
    |Disconnected|The local computer has issued a disconnect and it is waiting for confirmation from the remote system.|

-   This command is available only if the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol is installed as a component in the properties of a network adapter in Network Connections.
