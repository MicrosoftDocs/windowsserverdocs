# sfc

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions. If this command discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the **systemroot\system32\dllcache** folder, and then replaces the incorrect file.

> You must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group to run this command.
