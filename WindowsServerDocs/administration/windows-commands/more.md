### Examples

To view the first screen of information of a file named *Clients.new*, type one of the following commands:

```
more < clients.new
type clients.new | more
```

The **more** command displays the first screen of information from Clients.new, and you can press the SPACEBAR to see the next screen of information.

To clear the screen and remove all extra blank lines before displaying the file *Clients.new*, type one of the following commands:

```
more /c /s < clients.new
type clients.new | more /c /s
```

To display the current line number at the **more** prompt, type:

```
more =
```

The current line number is added to the **more** prompt, as `-- More [Line: 24] --`

To display a specific number of lines at the **more** prompt, type:

```
more p
```

The **more** prompt asks you for the number of lines to display, as follows: `-- More -- Lines:`. Type the number of lines to display, and then press ENTER. The screen changes to show only that number of lines.

To skip a specific number of lines at the **more** prompt, type:

```
more s
```

The **more** prompt asks you for the number of lines to skip, as follows: `-- More -- Lines:`. Type the number of lines to skip, and then press ENTER. The screen changes to show that those lines are skipped.
