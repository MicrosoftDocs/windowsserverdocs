# break (shadow copy volume)

Disassociates a shadow copy volume from VSS and makes it accessible as a regular volume. The volume can then be accessed using a drive letter (if assigned) or volume name. If used without parameters, **break** displays help at the command prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> This command is relevant only for hardware shadow copies after import.
>
> Exposed volumes, like the shadow copies they originate from, are read-only by default. Access to the volume is made directly to the hardware provider without record of the volume having been a shadow copy.

## Syntax

```
break [writable] <setid>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| [writable] | Enables read/write access on the volume. |
| \<setid> | Specifies the ID of the shadow copy set. The alias of the shadow copy ID, which is stored as an environment variable by the **load metadata** command, can be used in the *SetID* parameter. |

## Examples

To make a shadow copy using the alias name Alias1 accessible as a writable volume in the operating system:

```
break writable %Alias1%
```
