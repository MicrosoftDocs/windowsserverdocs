# Dnscmd

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

A command-line interface for managing DNS servers. This utility is useful in scripting batch files to help automate routine DNS management tasks, or to perform simple unattended setup and configuration of new DNS servers on your network.

## Syntax

```
dnscmd <servername> <command> [<command parameters>]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `<servername>` | The IP address or host name of a remote or local DNS server. |

## dnscmd /ageallrecords command

Sets the current time on a time stamp on resource records at a specified zone or node on a DNS server.

### Syntax

```
dnscmd [<servername>] /ageallrecords <zonename>[<nodename>] | [/tree]|[/f]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `<servername>` | Specifies the DNS server that the administrator plans to manage, represented by IP address, fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or Host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used. |
| `<zonename>` | Specifies the FQDN of the zone. |
| `<nodename>` | Specifies a specific node or subtree in the zone, using the following:<ul><li>**@** for root zone or FQDN</li><li>The FQDN of a node (the name with a period (.) at the end)</li><li>A single label for the name relative to the zone root.</li></ul> |
| /tree | Specifies that all child nodes also receive the time stamp. |
| /f | Runs the command without asking for confirmation. |

##### Remarks

- The **ageallrecords** command is for backward compatibility between the current version of DNS and previous releases of DNS in which aging and scavenging were not supported. It adds a time stamp with the current time to resource records that do not have a time stamp, and it sets the current time on resource records that do have a time stamp.

- Record scavenging does not occur unless the records are time stamped. Name server (NS) resource records, start of authority (SOA) resource records, and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) resource records are not included in the scavenging process, and they are not time stamped even when the **ageallrecords** command runs.

- This command fails unless scavenging is enabled for the DNS server and the zone. For information about how to enable scavenging for the zone, see the **aging** parameter, within the syntax of the `dnscmd /config` command in this article.

- The addition of a time stamp to DNS resource records makes them incompatible with DNS servers that run on operating systems other than Windows Server. A time stamp added by using the **ageallrecords** command can't be reversed.

- If none of the optional parameters are specified, the command returns all resource records at the specified node. If a value is specified for at least one of the optional parameters, **dnscmd** enumerates only the resource records that correspond to the value or values that are specified in the optional parameter or parameters.

### Examples

[Example 1: Set the current time on a time stamp to resource records](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc784399(v=ws.10)#example-1-set-the-current-time-on-a-time-stamp-to-resource-records)

## dnscmd /clearcache command

Clears the DNS cache memory of resource records on the specified DNS server.

### Syntax

```
dnscmd [<servername>] /clearcache
```

#### Parameters

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `<servername>` | Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used. |

### Example

```
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /clearcache
```

## dnscmd /config command

Changes values in the registry for the DNS server and individual zones. This command also modifies the configuration of the specified server. Accepts server-level and zone-level settings.

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't edit the registry directly unless you have no alternative. The registry editor bypasses standard safeguards, allowing settings that can degrade performance, damage your system, or even require you to reinstall Windows. You can safely alter most registry settings by using the programs in Control Panel or Microsoft Management Console (mmc). If you must edit the registry directly, back it up first. Read the registry editor help for more information.

### Server-level syntax

```
dnscmd [<servername>] /config <parameter>
```

Accepts the values:<ul><li>**0** - The DNS Server service attempts to resolve names by querying the GlobalNames zone before it queries the zones for which it is authoritative.</li><li>**1** - The DNS Server service attempts to resolve names by querying the zones for which it is authoritative before it queries the GlobalNames zone.</li></ul> |
| /globalqueryblocklist`[[<name> [<name>]...]` | Replaces the current global query block list with a list of the names that you specify. If you do not specify any names, this command clears the block list. By default, the global query block list contains the following items:<ul><li>isatap</li><li>wpad</li></ul>The DNS Server service can remove either or both of these names when it starts the first time, if it finds these names in an existing zone. |
| /isslave `[0|1]` | Determines how the DNS server responds when queries that it forwards receive no response. Accepts the values:<ul><li>**0** - Specifies that the DNS server is not a subordinate. If the forwarder does not respond, the DNS server attempts to resolve the query itself. This is the default setting.</li><li>**1** - Specifies that the DNS server is a subordinate. If the forwarder does not respond, the DNS server terminates the search and sends a failure message to the resolver.</li></ul> |
| /localnetpriority `[0|1]` | Determines the order in which host records are returned when the DNS server has multiple host records for the same name. Accepts the values:<ul><li>**0** - Returns the records in the order in which they are listed in the DNS database.</li><li>**1** - Returns the records that have similar IP network addresses first. This is the default setting.</li></ul> |

| /namecheckflag `[0|1|2|3]` | Specifies which character standard is used when checking DNS names. Accepts the values:<ul><li>**0** - Uses ANSI characters that comply with Internet Engineering Task force (IETF) Request for Comments (Rfcs).</li><li>**1** - Uses ANSI characters that do not necessarily comply with IETF Rfcs.</li><li>**2** - Uses multibyte UCS Transformation format 8 (UTF-8) characters. This is the default setting.</li><li>**3** - Uses all characters.</li></ul> |
| /norecursion `[0|1]` | Determines whether a DNS server performs recursive name resolution. Accepts the values:<ul><li>**0** - The DNS server performs recursive name resolution if it is requested in a query. This is the default setting.</li><li>**1** - The DNS server does not perform recursive name resolution.</li></ul> |
| /notcp | This parameter is obsolete, and it has no effect in current versions of Windows Server. |
| /recursionretry `[<seconds>]` | Determines the number of seconds (**0x1-0xFFFFFFFF**) that a DNS server waits before again trying to contact a remote server. The default setting is **0x3** (three seconds). This value should be increased when recursion occurs over a slow wide area network (WAN) link. |
| /recursiontimeout `[<seconds>]` | Determines the number of seconds (**0x1-0xFFFFFFFF**) that a DNS server waits before discontinuing attempts to contact a remote server. The settings range from **0x1** through **0xFFFFFFFF**. The default setting is **0xF** (15 seconds). This value should be increased when recursion occurs over a slow WAN link. |
| /roundrobin `[0|1]` | Determines the order in which host records are returned when a server has multiple host records for the same name. Accepts the values:<ul><li>**0** - The DNS server does not use round robin.

A setting greater than **0x0** enables scavenging for the server and sets the number of hours between scavenging cycles. |
| /secureresponses `[0|1]` | Determines whether DNS filters records that are saved in a cache. Accepts the values:<ul><li>**0** - Saves all responses to name queries to a cache. This is the default setting.</li><li>**1** - Saves only the records that belong to the same DNS subtree to a cache.</li></ul> |
| /sendport `[<port>]` | Specifies the port number (**0x0-0xFFFFFFFF**) that DNS uses to send recursive queries to other DNS servers. The default setting is **0x0**, which means that the port number is selected randomly. |
| /serverlevelplugindll`[<dllpath>]` | Specifies the path of a custom plug-in. When Dllpath specifies the fully qualified path name of a valid DNS server plug-in, the DNS server calls functions in the plug-in to resolve name queries that are outside the scope of all locally hosted zones. If a queried name is out of the scope of the plug-in, the DNS server performs name resolution using forwarding or recursion, as configured. If Dllpath is not specified, the DNS server ceases to use a custom plug-in if a custom plug-in was previously configured. |
| /strictfileparsing `[0|1]` | Determines a DNS server's behavior when it encounters an erroneous record while loading a zone. Accepts the values:<ul><li>**0** - The DNS server continues to load the zone even if the server encounters an erroneous record. The error is recorded in the DNS log. This is the default setting.</li><li>**1** - The DNS server stops loading the zone, and it records the error in the DNS log.</li></ul> |
| /updateoptions `<RecordValue>` | Prohibits dynamic updates of specified types of records. If you want more than one record type to be prohibited in the log, use hexadecimal addition to add the values, and then enter the sum.

During secure dynamic update, excludes root name server (NS) resource records and start of authority (SOA) resource records. Allows delegations and server host updates.</li><li>**0x400** - During secure dynamic update, excludes delegation name server (NS) resource records.</li><li>**0x800** - During secure dynamic update, excludes server host records.</li><li>**0x1000000** - Excludes delegation signer (DS) records.</li><li>**0x80000000** - Disables DNS dynamic update.</li></ul> |
| /writeauthorityns `[0|1]` | Determines when the DNS server writes name server (NS) resource records in the Authority section of a response. Accepts the values:<ul><li>**0** - Writes name server (NS) resource records in the Authority section of referrals only.

```

## dnscmd /recorddelete command

Deletes a resource record to a specified zone.

### Syntax

```
dnscmd [<servername>] /recorddelete <zonename> <nodename> <rrtype> <rrdata> [/f]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `<servername>` | Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used. |
| `<zonename>` | Specifies the zone in which the resource record resides. |

| `<rrtype>` | Specifies the type of resource record to be deleted. |
| `<rrdata>` | Specifies the type of data that is expected. |
| /f | Executes the command without asking for confirmation. Because nodes can have more than one resource record, this command requires you to be very specific about the type of resource record that you want to delete. If you specify a data type and you do not specify a type of resource record data, all records with that specific data type for the specified node are deleted. |

#### Examples

```
dnscmd /recorddelete test.contoso.com test MX 10 mailserver.test.contoso.com
```

## dnscmd /resetforwarders command

Selects or resets the IP addresses to which the DNS server forwards DNS queries when it cannot resolve them locally.

### Syntax

```
dnscmd [<servername>] /resetforwarders <IPaddress> [,<IPaddress>]...][/timeout <timeout>] [/slave | /noslave]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `<servername>` | Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used. |
| `<IPaddress>` | Lists the IP addresses to which the DNS server forwards unresolved queries. |
| /timeout `<timeout>` | Sets the number of seconds that the DNS server waits for a response from the forwarder. By default, this value is five seconds. |
| /slave | Prevents the DNS server from performing its own iterative queries if the forwarder fails to resolve a query. |
| /noslave | Allows the DNS server to perform its own iterative queries if the forwarder fails to resolve a query. This is the default setting. |
| /f | Executes the command without asking for confirmation. Because nodes can have more than one resource record, this command requires you to be very specific about the type of resource record that you want to delete. If you specify a data type and you do not specify a type of resource record data, all records with that specific data type for the specified node are deleted. |

##### Remarks

- By default, a DNS server performs iterative queries when it cannot resolve a query.

- Setting IP addresses by using the **resetforwarders** command causes the DNS server to perform recursive queries to the DNS servers at the specified IP addresses. If the forwarders don't resolve the query, the DNS server can then perform its own iterative queries.

- If the **/slave** parameter is used, the DNS server does not perform its own iterative queries. This means that the DNS server forwards unresolved queries only to the DNS servers in the list, and it does not attempt iterative queries if the forwarders do not resolve them. It is more efficient to set one IP address as a forwarder for a DNS server. You can use the **resetforwarders** command for internal servers in a network to forward their unresolved queries to one DNS server that has an external connection.

- Listing a forwarder's IP address twice causes the DNS server to attempt to forward to that server twice.

#### Examples

```
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /resetforwarders 10.0.0.1 /timeout 7 /slave
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /resetforwarders /noslave
```

## dnscmd /resetlistenaddresses command

Specifies the IP addresses on a server that listens for DNS client requests. By default, all IP addresses on a DNS server listen for client DNS requests.

### Syntax

```
dnscmd [<servername>] /resetlistenaddresses <listenaddress>
```

#### Parameters

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `<servername>` | Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used. |
| `<listenaddress>` | Specifies an IP address on the DNS server that listens for DNS client requests. If no listen address is specified, all IP addresses on the server listen for client requests. |

#### Examples

```
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /resetlistenaddresses 10.0.0.1
```

## dnscmd /startscavenging command

Tells a DNS server to attempt an immediate search for stale resource records in a specified DNS server.

### Syntax

```
dnscmd [<servername>] /startscavenging
```

#### Parameters

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `<servername>` | Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used. |

##### Remarks

- Successful completion of this command starts a scavenge immediately. If the scavenge fails, no warning message appears.

- Although the command to start the scavenge appears to complete successfully, the scavenge does not start unless the following preconditions are met:

    - Scavenging is enabled for both the server and the zone.

    - The zone is started.

    - The resource records have a time stamp.

- For information about how to enable scavenging for the server, see the **scavenginginterval** parameter under **Server-level syntax** in the **/config** section.

- For information about how to enable scavenging for the zone, see the **aging** parameter under **Zone-level syntax** in the **/config** section.

- For information about how to restart a paused zone, see the **zoneresume** parameter in this article.

- For information about how to check resource records for a time stamp, see the **ageallrecords** parameter in this article.

#### Examples

```
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /startscavenging
```

Each type has different required parameters, including:<ul><li>**/dsprimary** - Creates an active directory integrated zone.</li><li>**/primary /file `<filename>`** - Creates a standard primary zone.</li><li>**/secondary `<masterIPaddress> [,<masterIPaddress>...]`** - Creates a standard secondary zone.</li><li>**/stub `<masterIPaddress>[,<masterIPaddress>...]` /file `<filename>`** - Creates a file-backed stub zone.</li><li>**/dsstub `<masterIPaddress>[,<masterIPaddress>...]`** - Creates an active directory integrated stub zone.</li><li>**/forwarder `<masterIPaddress[,<masterIPaddress>]`... /file`<filename>`** - Specifies that the created zone forwards unresolved queries to another DNS server.</li><li>**/dsforwarder** - Specifies that the created active directory integrated zone forwards unresolved queries to another DNS server.</li></ul> |
| /overwrite_mem | Overwrites DNS data from data in AD DS. |
| /overwrite_ds | Overwrites existing data in AD DS. |

##### Remarks

- Setting the zone type as **/dsforwarder** creates a zone that performs conditional forwarding.

#### Examples

```
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /zoneresettype test.contoso.com /primary /file test.contoso.com.dns
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /zoneresettype second.contoso.com /secondary 10.0.0.2
```

## dnscmd /zoneresume command
