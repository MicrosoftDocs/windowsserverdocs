# forfiles

Selects and runs a command on a file or set of files. This command is most commonly used in batch files.

## Syntax

```
forfiles [/P pathname] [/M searchmask] [/S] [/C command] [/D [+ | -] [{<date> | <days>}]]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| /P `<pathname>` | Specifies the path from which to start the search. By default, searching starts in the current working directory. |
| /M `<searchmask>` | Searches files according to the specified search mask. The default searchmask is `*`. |
| /S | Instructs the **forfiles** command to search in subdirectories recursively. |
| /C `<command>` | Runs the specified command on each file. Command strings should be wrapped in double quotes. The default command is `"cmd /c echo @file"`. |
| /D `[{+\|-}][{<date> | <days>}]` | Selects files with a last modified date within the specified time frame:<ul><li>Selects files with a last modified date later than or equal to (**+**) or earlier than or equal to (**-**) the specified date, where *date* is in the format MM/DD/YYYY.</li><li>Selects files with a last modified date later than or equal to (**+**) the current date plus the number of days specified, or earlier than or equal to (**-**) the current date minus the number of days specified.</li><li>Valid values for *days* include any number in the range 0â€“32,768. If no sign is specified, **+** is used by default.</li></ul> |
| /? | Displays the help text in the cmd window. |

#### Remarks

- The `forfiles /S` command is similar to `dir /S`.

- You can use the following variables in the command string as specified by the **/C** command-line option:

    | Variable | Description |
    | -------- | ----------- |
    | @FILE | File name. |
    | @FNAME | File name without extension. |
    | @EXT | File name extension. |
    | @PATH | Full path of the file. |
    | @RELPATH | Relative path of the file. |
    | @ISDIR | Evaluates to TRUE if a file type is a directory. Otherwise, this variable evaluates to FALSE. |
    | @FSIZE | File size, in bytes. |
    | @FDATE | Last modified date stamp on the file. |
    | @FTIME | Last modified time stamp on the file. |

- The **forfiles** command lets you run a command on or pass arguments to multiple files. For example, you could run the **type** command on all files in a tree with the .txt file name extension. Or you could execute every batch file (*.bat) on drive C, with the file name Myinput.txt as the first argument.

- This command can:

    - Select files by an absolute date or a relative date by using the **/d** parameter.

    - Build an archive tree of files by using variables such as @FSIZE and @FDATE.

    - Differentiate files from directories by using the @ISDIR variable.

    - Include special characters in the command line by using the hexadecimal code for the character, in 0x*HH* format (for example, 0x09 for a tab).

- This command works by implementing the `recurse subdirectories` flag on tools that are designed to process only a single file.

### Examples

To list all of the batch files on drive C, type:

```
forfiles /P c:\ /S /M *.bat /C "cmd /c echo @file is a batch file"
```

To list all of the directories on drive C, type:

```
forfiles /P c:\ /S /M * /C "cmd /c if @isdir==TRUE echo @file is a directory"
```

To list all of the files in the current directory that are at least one year old, type:

```
forfiles /S /M *.* /D -365 /C "cmd /c echo @file is at least one year old."
```

To display the text *file* is outdated for each of the files in the current directory that are older than January 1, 2007, type:

```
forfiles /S /M *.* /D -01/01/2007 /C "cmd /c echo @file is outdated."
```

To list the file name extensions of all the files in the current directory in column format, and add a tab before the extension, type:

```
forfiles /S /M *.* /C "cmd /c echo The extension of @file is 0x09@ext"
```
