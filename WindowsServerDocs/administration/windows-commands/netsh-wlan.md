## Parameters

| Command | Description |
|--|--|
| wlan `add` | `filter` - Adds a wireless network into either the wireless network *allowed* or *disallowed* list. The parameter `ssid` is required if the permission is set to `allow` or `block`. If `denyall` is set, `ssid` isn't required. <br><br> `permission` - Sets the permission type of the filter. <br> - `allow` <br> - `block` <br> - `denyall` <br> `ssid` - The SSID of the wireless network. <br> `networktype` - The network type of the wireless network. <br> - `infrastructure` <br> - `adhoc` <br><br> `profile` - Adds a WLAN profile to the specified network interface: <br> - `filename` (required): Specifies the XML file containing the profile data. <br> - `interface` (optional): The name of the wireless interface, as listed by the `show interface` command. If provided, the profile is added only to the specified interface; otherwise, it's added to all wireless interfaces. <br> - `user` (optional): Determines whether the profile applies to all (`all`) users or only the current (`current`) user. By default, the profile is applied to all users. |
| wlan `connect` | Connects to a wireless network using the specified profile. If more than one network interface is available, you must specify which interface to use, otherwise the interface parameter can be omitted. <br><br> The profile name is required, while the Service Set Identifier (SSID) is optional. If the profile contains only one SSID, it's used automatically. If multiple SSIDs exist in the profile, you must specify the SSID. <br><br> When you specify an interface, wildcard names aren't supported. If the chosen interface is already connected to a wireless network, the command disconnects from the current network before attempting to connect to the new one. If the current and target networks are the same, the command returns success without making changes. <br><br> `ssid`: Specifies the SSID of the wireless network. <br> `name`: Specifies the profile name to use for the connection attempt. <br> `interface`: Specifies the interface name from which the connection is attempted. |
| wlan `delete` | `filter` - Removes a wireless network from the wireless network *allowed* or *disallowed* list. The parameter `ssid` is required if the permission is set to `allow` or `block`. If `denyall` is set, `ssid` isn't required. <br><br> `permission` - Sets the permission type of the filter. <br> - `allow` <br> - `block` <br> - `denyall` <br> `ssid` - The SSID of the wireless network. <br> `networktype` - The network type of the wireless network. <br> - `infrastructure` <br> - `adhoc` <br><br> `profile` - Removes a WLAN profile from the specified network interface: <br> - `name` (required): Specifies the name of the profile to remove. The profile name can have wildcard characters and multiple profiles with the matching name is removed. <br> - `interface` (optional): The name of the wireless interface, as listed by the `show interface` command. If provided, the profile is removed only from the specified interface; otherwise, it's removed from all wireless interfaces. |
| wlan `disconnect` | Disconnects the device from the wireless network on the specified interface. The `interface=` parameter is required if there are two or more available interfaces on the device. Wildcard characters can be used to specify multiple interfaces. |
| wlan `dump` | Creates a script containing the current context configuration. The script can be saved to a file and used to restore settings if they're altered or need to be replicated on another system. |
| wlan `export` | Exports selected WLAN profiles to XML files in the specified folder. Each exported profile is saved as "Interface Name-Profile Name.xml". <br><br> `hostednetworkprofile` - Exports the hosted network profile to an XML file. <br><br> `profile` - Exports the specified profiles to an XML file. Options are: <br> - `name`: Specifies the profile name to export. <br> - `folder`: Specifies the destination folder for the exported profile XML files. <br> - `interface`: Specifies the network interface associated with the profile. <br> - `key`: To display the security key in plain text, use `key=clear`. <br><br> The `folder`, `name`, and `interface` parameters are optional. <br> - If `name` is specified, only that profile is exported; otherwise, all profiles are exported. <br> - If `folder` is provided, it must be an existing, accessible local folder (absolute or relative path). **"."** refers to the current directory, and **".."** to its parent. UNC paths aren't supported. By default, profiles are saved in the current directory. <br> - If `interface` is specified, only the profile on that interface is exported; otherwise, all profiles with the given name are exported. <br> - If the `key` parameter is set to plain text and the caller is a local administrator, the XML file includes the key in plain text. Otherwise, the key is encrypted in the output file. |
| wlan `IHV` | `startlogging` - Starts verbose logging for Wi-Fi Independent Hardware Vendor (IHV) events. <br> `stoplogging` - Stops verbose logging for Wi-Fi IHV events. |
| wlan `refresh` | Refreshes the settings of the hosted wireless network. <br> <br> `data` - Instructs the WLAN service to update the hosted network with a new security key. |
| wlan `reportissues` | Generates a WLAN smart trace report to help diagnosing and reporting wireless network issues. |
| wlan `set allowexplicitcreds` | `allow` - Enables (`yes`) or disables (`no`) the use of explicit credentials for WLAN connections. This parameter is required. |
| wlan `set autoconfig` | `enabled` - Turns WLAN auto-configuration to on (`yes`) or off (`no`). <br> `interface` - Specifies the wireless network interface to configure. <br><br> If `enabled=no` is set, then Windows doesn't connect to any wireless network automatically from the specified interface. |
| wlan `set blockednetworks` | `display` - Shows (`show`) or hides (`hide`) blocked wireless networks in the network list. If `display=hide` is set, blocked networks aren't displayed in the list of available wireless networks. |
| wlan `set blockperiod` | `value` - Sets the period (in minutes, `0` to `60`) to block a wireless network after a failed connection attempt. The blocked status is cleared when you manually attempt to connect, when the user session changes, or when the network interface reconnects. |

| wlan `set hostednetwork` | `mode` - Enables (`allow`) or disables (`disallow`) the hosted network feature. <br> `ssid` - Sets the SSID (network name) for the hosted network. <br> `key` - Specifies the passphrase for the hosted network. The user security key should be a string with 8 to 63 ASCII characters. <br>  `keyUsage` - Determines if the key is `persistent` or `temporary`. If `keyUsage` is set to `persistent`, the security key is saved and reused whenever the hosted network is started in the future. If set to `temporary`, the key is used only for the current or next hosted network session and is deleted when the hosted network is stopped. If `keyUsage` isn't specified, the key defaults to `persistent`. |
| wlan `set profileorder` | Sets the preference order of a wireless network profile for a specific interface. All three parameters (`name`, `interface`, and `priority`) are required. Only *User* profiles can have their order changed. Group Policy profiles are read-only and always take precedence over *User* profiles. The `priority` parameter determines the new position of the profile in the preferred *User* profile list. For example, setting `priority=1` moves the profile to the top of the *User* profile list. <br><br> `name` - Specifies the name of the wireless profile. <br> `interface` - Specifies the wireless network interface to apply the profile order. <br> `priority` - Sets the priority (integer value) of the profile. |
| wlan `profileparameter` | Modifies the specified profile. If the interface is specified, then only the profile on that interface is modified. The `name` parameter is required. At least one other parameter besides the profile name and interface must also be specified. <br><br> `name`: Specifies the name of the wireless profile. <br> `interface`: Specifies the wireless network interface. <br> `SSIDname`: Specifies the SSID for the profile. <br> `ConnectionType` - Specifies whether the network is infrastructure (`ESS`) or ad-hoc (`IBSS`). <br> `ConnectionMode` - Sets the connection mode to automatic (`auto`) or manual (`manual`). Must be set to `manual` for ad-hoc (`IBSS`) networks. <br> `autoSwitch` - Determines if the device automatically switches to a more preferred network when available (`yes` or `no`). <br> `randomization` - Enables (`yes`) or disables (`no`) MAC address randomization for privacy.
