# ksetup delhosttorealmmap

Removes a service principal name (SPN) mapping between the stated host and the realm. This command also removes any mapping between a host to realm (or multiple hosts to realm).

The mapping is stored in the registry, under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentContolSet\Lsa\Kerberos\HostToRealm`. After running this command, we recommend making sure the mapping appears in the registry.

## Syntax

```
ksetup /delhosttorealmmap <hostname> <realmname>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `<hostname>` | Specifies the fully-qualified domain name of the computer. |
| `<realmname>` | Specifies the uppercase DNS name, such as CORP.CONTOSO.COM. |

### Examples

To change the configuration of the realm CONTOSO, and to delete the mapping of the host computer IPops897 to the realm, type:

```
ksetup /delhosttorealmmap IPops897 CONTOSO
```
