> ## Remarks
> - You can use this command to find out if a specific user is logged on to a specific rd Session Host server. **query user** returns the following information:
>   -   The name of the user
>   -   The name of the session on the rd Session Host server
>   -   The session ID
>   -   The state of the session (active or disconnected)
>   -   The idle time (the number of minutes since the last keystroke or mouse movement at the session)
>   -   The date and time the user logged on
> - To use **query user**, you must have Full Control permission or query Information special access permission.
> - if you use **query user** without specifying <*UserName*>, <*SessionName*>, or <*SessionID*>, a list of all users who are logged on to the server is returned. Alternatively, you can also use **query session** to display a list of all sessions on a server.
> - When **query user** returns information, a greater than (>) symbol is displayed before the current session.
> - The **/server** parameter is required only if you use **query user** from a remote server.
>   ## <a name="BKMK_examples"></a>Examples
