# timeout

Pauses the command processor for the specified number of seconds.



## Syntax

```
timeout /t <TimeoutInSeconds> [/nobreak] 
```

### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|/t \<TimeoutInSeconds>|Specifies the decimal number of seconds (between -1 and 99999) to wait before the command processor continues processing. The value -1 causes the computer to wait indefinitely for a keystroke.|
|/nobreak|Specifies to ignore user key strokes.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

## Remarks

-   The **timeout** command is typically used in batch files.
-   A user keystroke resumes the command processor execution immediately, even if the timeout period has not expired.
-   When used in conjunction with the **sleep** command, **timeout** is similar to the **pause** command.

## Examples

To pause the command processor for ten seconds, type:
```
timeout /t 10
```
To pause the command processor for 100 seconds and ignore any keystroke, type:
```
timeout /t 100 /nobreak
```
To pause the command processor indefinitely until a key is pressed, type:
```
timeout /t -1
```
