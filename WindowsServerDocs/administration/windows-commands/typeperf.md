# typeperf

The **typeperf** command writes performance data to the command window or to a log file. To stop **typeperf**, press CTRL+C.

## Syntax

```
typeperf <counter [counter ...]> [options]
typeperf -cf <filename> [options]
typeperf -q [object] [options]
typeperf -qx [object] [options]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| `<counter [counter [...]]>` | Specifies performance counters to monitor. The `<counter>` parameter is the full name of a performance counter in \\Computer\Object(Instance)\Counter format, such as `\\Server1\Processor(0)\% User Time`.  |

#### Options

| Option | Description |
|--|--|
| -f `<CSV | TSV | BIN | SQL>` | Specifies the output file format. The default is CSV. |
| -cf `<filename>` | Specifies a file containing a list of performance counters to monitor, with one counter per line. |
| -si `<[[hh:]mm:]ss>` | Specifies the sample interval. The default is one second. |
| -o `<filename>` | Specifies the path for the output file, or the SQL database. The default is STDOUT (written to the command window). |
| -q `[object]` | Display a list of installed counters (no instances). To list counters for one object, include the object name. |
| -qx `[object]` | Display a list of installed counters with instances. To list counters for one object, include the object name. |
| -sc `<samples>` | Specifies the number of samples to collect. The default is to collect data until CTRL+C is pressed. |
| -config `<filename>` | Specifies a settings file containing command options. |
| -s `<computer_name>` | Specifies a remote computer to monitor if no computer is specified in the counter path. |
| -y | Answer *yes* to all questions without prompting. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

## Examples

To write the values for the local computer's performance counter `\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time` to the command window at a default sample interval of 1 second until CTRL+C is pressed, type:

```
typeperf \Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time
```

To write the values for the list of counters in the file *counters.txt* to the tab-delimited file *domain2.tsv* at a sample interval of 5 seconds until 50 samples have been collected, type:

```
typeperf -cf counters.txt -si 5 -sc 50 -f TSV -o domain2.tsv
```

To query installed counters with instances for the counter object *PhysicalDisk* and writes the resulting list to the file *counters.txt*, type:

```
typeperf -qx PhysicalDisk -o counters.txt
```
