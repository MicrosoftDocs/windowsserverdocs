# ftp glob



Toggles allowing wildcard expansion for local file names. By default, globbing (wildcard expansion) is turned on. If globbing is turned on, you'll be able to use the asterisk (*) and question mark (?) as wildcard characters in local file or path names.

## Syntax

```
glob
```

### Examples

To toggle whether to allow wildcard expansion of local file names, type:

```
glob
```
