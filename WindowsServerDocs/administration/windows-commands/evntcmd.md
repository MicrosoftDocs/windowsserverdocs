# evntcmd

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Configures the translation of events to traps, trap destinations, or both based on information in a configuration file.

## Syntax

```
evntcmd [/s <computername>] [/v <verbositylevel>] [/n] <filename>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| /s `<computername>` | Specifies, by name, the computer on which you want to configure the translation of events to traps, trap destinations, or both. If you do not specify a computer, the configuration occurs on the local computer. |
| /v `<verbositylevel>` | Specifies which types of status messages appear as traps and trap destinations are configured. This parameter must be an integer between 0 and 10. If you specify 10, all types of messages appear, including tracing messages and warnings about whether trap configuration was successful. If you specify 0, no messages appear. |
| /n | Specifies that the SNMP service should not be restarted if this computer receives trap configuration changes. |
| `<filename>` | Specifies, by name, the configuration file that contains information about the translation of events to traps and trap destinations you want to configure. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

#### Remarks

- if you want to configure traps but not trap destinations, you can create a valid configuration file by using Event to Trap Translator, which is a graphical utility. If you have the SNMP service installed, you can start Event to Trap Translator by typing **evntwin** at a command prompt. After you have defined the traps you want, click **Export** to create a file suitable for use with **evntcmd**. You can use Event to Trap Translator to easily create a configuration file and then use the configuration file with **evntcmd** at the command prompt to quickly configure traps on multiple computers.

- The syntax for configuring a trap is as follows:

  ```
  #pragma add <eventlogfile> <eventsource> <eventID> [<count> [<period>]]
  ```

  Where the text following is true:

    - **#pragma** must appear at the beginning of every entry in the file.

    - The parameter **add** specifies that you want to add an event to trap configuration.

    - The parameters **eventlogfile**, **eventsource**, and **eventID** are required, and where **eventlogfile** specifies the file in which the event is recorded, **eventsource** specifies the application that generates the event and **eventID** specifies the unique number that identifies each event.

    To determine what values correspond to each event, start the Event to Trap Translator by typing **evntwin** at a command prompt. Click **Custom**, and then click **edit**. Under **Event Sources**, browse the folders until you locate the event you want to configure, click it, and then click **add**. Information about the event source, the event log file, and the event ID appear under **Source,  Log**, and **Trap specific ID**, respectively.

    - The **count** parameter is optional, and it specifies how many times the event must occur before a trap message is sent. If you don't use this parameter, the trap message is sent after the event occurs once.

    - The **period** parameter is optional, but it requires you to use the **count** parameter. The **period** parameter specifies a length of time (in seconds) during which the event must occur the number of times specified with the **count** parameter before a trap message is sent. If you don't use this parameter, a trap message is sent after the event occurs the number of times specified with the ***count*** parameter, no matter how much time elapses between occurrences.

- The syntax for removing a trap is as follows:

  ```
  #pragma delete <eventlogfile> <eventsource> <eventID>
  ```

  Where the text following is true:

    - **#pragma** must appear at the beginning of every entry in the file.

    - The parameter **delete** specifies that you want to remove an event to trap configuration.

    - The parameters **eventlogfile**, **eventsource**, and **eventID** are required, and where **eventlogfile** specifies the file in which the event is recorded, **eventsource** specifies the application that generates the event and **eventID** specifies the unique number that identifies each event.

    To determine what values correspond to each event, start the Event to Trap Translator by typing **evntwin** at a command prompt. Click **Custom**, and then click **edit**. Under **Event Sources**, browse the folders until you locate the event you want to configure, click it, and then click **add**. Information about the event source, the event log file, and the event ID appear under **Source,  Log**, and **Trap specific ID**, respectively.

- The syntax for configuring a trap destination is as follows:

  ```
  #pragma add_TRAP_DEST <communityname> <hostID>
  ```

  Where the text following is true:

    - **#pragma** must appear at the beginning of every entry in the file.

    - The parameter **add_TRAP_DEST** specifies that you want trap messages to be sent to a specified host within a community.

    - The parameter **communityname** specifies, by name, the community in which trap messages are sent.

    - The parameter **hostID** specifies, by name or IP address, the host to which you want trap messages to be sent.

- The syntax for removing a trap destination is as follows:

  ```
  #pragma delete_TRAP_DEST <communityname> <hostID>
  ```

  Where the text following is true:

    - **#pragma** must appear at the beginning of every entry in the file.

    - The parameter **delete_TRAP_DEST** specifies that you do not want trap messages to be sent to a specified host within a community.

    - The parameter **communityname** specifies, by name, the community to which trap messages shouldn't be sent.

    - The parameter **hostID** specifies, by name or IP address, the host to which you don't want trap messages to be sent.

### Examples

The following examples illustrate entries in the configuration file for the **evntcmd** command. They are not designed to be typed at a command prompt.

To send a trap message if the Event Log service is restarted, type:

```
#pragma add System Eventlog 2147489653
```

To send a trap message if the Event Log service is restarted twice in three minutes, type:

```
#pragma add System Eventlog 2147489653 2 180
```

To stop sending a trap message whenever the Event Log service is restarted, type:

```
#pragma delete System Eventlog 2147489653
```

To send trap messages within the community named *Public* to the host with the IP address *192.168.100.100*, type:

```
#pragma add_TRAP_DEST public 192.168.100.100
```

To send trap messages within the community named *Private* to the host named *Host1*, type:

```
#pragma add_TRAP_DEST private Host1
```

To stop sending trap messages within the community named *Private* to the same computer on which you are configuring trap destinations, type:

```
#pragma delete_TRAP_DEST private localhost
```
