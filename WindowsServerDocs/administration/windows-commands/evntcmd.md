# Evntcmd

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Configures the translation of events to traps, trap destinations, or both based on information in a configuration file.   
## Syntax  
```  
evntcmd [/s <computerName>] [/v <verbosityLevel>] [/n] <FileName>  
```  
### Parameters  

|      Parameter      |                                                                                                                                                            Description                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  /s <computerName>  |                                                         Specifies, by name, the computer on which you want to configure the translation of events to traps, trap destinations, or both. If you do not specify a computer, the configuration occurs on the local computer.                                                          |
| /v <verbosityLevel> | Specifies which types of status messages appear as traps and trap destinations are configured. This parameter must be an integer between 0 and 10. If you specify 10, all types of messages appear, including tracing messages and warnings about whether trap configuration was successful. If you specify 0, no messages appear. |
|         /n          |                                                                                                           Specifies that the SNMP service should not be restarted if this computer receives trap configuration changes.                                                                                                            |
|     <FileName>      |                                                                                     Specifies, by name, the configuration file that contains information about the translation of events to traps and trap destinations you want to configure.                                                                                     |
|         /?          |                                                                                                                                                Displays help at the command prompt.                                                                                                                                                |

## Remarks  
- if you want to configure traps but not trap destinations, you can create a valid configuration file by using Event to Trap Translator, which is a graphical utility. If you have the SNMP service installed, you can start Event to Trap Translator by typing **evntwin** at a command prompt. After you have defined the traps you want, click Export to create a file suitable for use with **evntcmd**. You can use Event to Trap Translator to easily create a configuration file and then use the configuration file with **evntcmd** at the command prompt to quickly configure traps on multiple computers.  
- The syntax for configuring a trap is as follows:  
  **#pragma add**<em><EventLogFile> <EventSource> <EventID> [<Count> [<Period>]]</em>  
  -   The text **#pragma** must appear at the beginning of every entry in the file.  
  -   The parameter **add** specifies that you want to add an event to trap configuration.  
  -   The parameters *EventLogFile*, *EventSource*, and *EventID* are required. The parameter *EventLogFile* specifies the file in which the event is recorded. The parameter *EventSource* specifies the application that generates the event. The *EventID* parameter specifies the unique number that identifies each event. To find out what values correspond to particular events, start Event to Trap Translator by typing **evntwin** at a command prompt. Click **Custom**, and then click **edit**. Under **Event Sources**, browse the folders until you locate the event you want to configure, click it, and then click **add**. Information about the event source, the event log file, and the event ID appear under **Source,  Log**, and **Trap specific ID**, respectively.  
  -   The *Count* parameter is optional, and it specifies how many times the event must occur before a trap message is sent. If you do not use the *Count* parameter, the trap message is sent after the event occurs once.  
  -   The *Period* parameter is optional, but it requires you to use the *Count* parameter. The *Period* parameter specifies a length of time (in seconds) during which the event must occur the number of times specified with the Count parameter before a trap message is sent. If you do not use the *Period* parameter, a trap message is sent after the event occurs the number of times specified with the *Count* parameter, no matter how much time elapses between occurrences.  
- The syntax for removing a trap is as follows:  
  **#pragma delete**<em><EventLogFile> <EventSource> <EventID></em>  
  -   The text **#pragma** must appear at the beginning of every entry in the file.  
  -   The parameter *delete* specifies that you want to remove an event to trap configuration.  
  -   The parameters *EventLogFile*,  *EventSource*, and *EventID* are required. The parameter *EventLogFile* specifies the log in which the event is recorded. The parameter *EventSource* specifies the application that generates the event. The *EventID* parameter specifies the unique number that identifies each event.  
- The syntax for configuring a trap destination is as follows:  
  **#pragma add_TRAP_DEST**<em><CommunityName> <HostID></em>  
  -   The text **#pragma** must appear at the beginning of every entry in the file.  
  -   The parameter **add_TRAP_DEST** specifies that you want trap messages to be sent to a specified host within a community.  
  -   The parameter *CommunityName* specifies, by name, the community in which trap messages are sent.  
  -   The parameter *HostID* specifies, by name or IP address, the host to which you want trap messages to be sent.  
- The syntax for removing a trap destination is as follows:  
  **#pragma delete_TRAP_DEST**<em><CommunityName> <HostID></em>  
  - The text **#pragma** must appear at the beginning of every entry in the file.  
  - The parameter *delete_TRAP_DEST* specifies that you do not want trap messages to be sent to a specified host within a community.  
  - The parameter *CommunityName* specifies, by name, the community in which trap messages are sent.  
  - The parameter *HostID* specifies, by name or IP address, the host to which you do not want trap messages to be sent.  
    ## <a name="BKMK_Examples"></a>Examples  
    The following examples illustrate entries in the configuration file for the **evntcmd** command. They are not designed to be typed at a command prompt.  
    To send a trap message if the Event Log service is restarted, type:  
    ```  
    #pragma add System "Eventlog" 2147489653  
    ```  
    To send a trap message if the Event Log service is restarted twice in three minutes, type:  
    ```  
    #pragma add System "Eventlog" 2147489653 2 180  
    ```  
    To stop sending a trap message whenever the Event Log service is restarted, type:  
    ```  
    #pragma delete System "Eventlog" 2147489653  
    ```  
    To send trap messages within the community named Public to the host with the IP address 192.168.100.100, type:  
    ```  
    #pragma add_TRAP_DEST public 192.168.100.100  
    ```  
    To send trap messages within the community named Private to the host named Host1, type:  
    ```  
    #pragma add_TRAP_DEST private Host1  
    ```  
    To stop sending trap messages within the community named Private to the same computer on which you are configuring trap destinations, type:  
    ```  
    #pragma delete_TRAP_DEST private localhost  
    ```
