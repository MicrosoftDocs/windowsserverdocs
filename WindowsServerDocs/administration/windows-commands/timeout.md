# timeout

Pauses the command processor for the specified number of seconds. This command is typically used in batch files.

## Syntax

```
timeout /t <timeoutinseconds> [/nobreak]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| /t `<timeoutinseconds>` | Specifies the decimal number of seconds (between -1 and 99999) to wait before the command processor continues processing. The value **-1** causes the computer to wait indefinitely for a keystroke. |
| /nobreak | Specifies to ignore user key strokes. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

#### Remarks

- A user keystroke resumes the command processor execution immediately, even if the timeout period has not expired.

- When used in conjunction with the resource kit's **Sleep** tool, **timeout** is similar to the **pause** command.

## Examples

To pause the command processor for ten seconds, type:

```
timeout /t 10
```

To pause the command processor for 100 seconds and ignore any keystroke, type:

```
timeout /t 100 /nobreak
```

To pause the command processor indefinitely until a key is pressed, type:

```
timeout /t -1
```
