# msinfo32

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Opens the System Information tool to display a comprehensive view of the hardware, system components, and software environment on the local computer.

Some System Information categories contain large amounts of data. You can use the **start /wait** command to optimize reporting performance for these categories. For more information, see [System Information](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc783305(v=ws.10)).

## Syntax

```
msinfo32 [/pch] [/nfo <path>] [/report <path>] [/computer <computername>] [/showcategories] [/category <categoryID>] [/categories {+<categoryID>(+<categoryID>)|+all(-<categoryID>)}]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `<path>` | Specifies the file to be opened in the format *C:\Folder1\File1.xxx*, where *C* is the drive letter, *Folder1* is the folder, *File1* is the file name, and *xxx* is the file name extension.<p>This file can be an **.nfo**, **.xml**, **.txt**, or **.cab** file. |
| `<computername>` | Specifies the name of the target or local computer. This can be a UNC name, an IP address, or a full computer name. |
| `<categoryID>` | Specifies the ID of the category item. You can obtain the category ID by using **/showcategories**. |
| /pch | Displays the System History view in the System Information tool. |
| /nfo | Saves the exported file as an **.nfo** file. If the file name that is specified in *path* does not end in an **.nfo** extension, the **.nfo** extension is automatically appended to the file name. |
| /report | Saves the file in *path* as a text file. The file name is saved exactly as it appears in *path*. The .txt extension is not appended to the file unless it is specified in path. |
| /computer | Starts the System Information tool for the specified remote computer. You must have the appropriate permissions to access the remote computer. |
| /showcategories | Starts the System Information tool with all available category IDs displayed, rather than displaying the friendly or localized names. For example, the Software Environment category is displayed as the **SWEnv** category. |
| /category | Starts System Information with the specified category selected. Use **/showcategories** to display a list of available category IDs. |
| /categories | Starts System Information with only the specified category or categories displayed. It also limits the output to the selected category or categories. Use **/showcategories** to display a list of available category IDs. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

### Examples

To list the available category IDs, type:

```
msinfo32 /showcategories
```

To start the System Information tool with all available information displayed, except Loaded Modules, type:

```
msinfo32 /categories +all -loadedmodules
```

To display **System Summary** information and to create an .nfo file called *syssum.nfo*, which contains information in the **System Summary** category, type:

```
msinfo32 /nfo syssum.nfo /categories +systemsummary
```

To display resource conflict information and to create an .nfo file called *conflicts.nfo*, which contains information about resource conflicts, type:

```
msinfo32 /nfo conflicts.nfo /categories +componentsproblemdevices+resourcesconflicts+resourcesforcedhardware
```
