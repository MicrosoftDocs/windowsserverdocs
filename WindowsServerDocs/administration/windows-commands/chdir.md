# chdir



Displays the name of the current directory or changes the current directory. If used with only a drive letter (for example, `chdir C:`), **chdir** displays the names of the current directory in the specified drive. If used without parameters, **chdir** displays the current drive and directory.

> > [!NOTE]
> This command has been replaced by the **cd command**. For more information, including the syntax and parameter details, see [cd command](cd.md).
