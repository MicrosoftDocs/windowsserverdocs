# dcpromo

Applies To: Windows Server (All supported versions)

The dcpromo command installs, promotes, demotes, and removes Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) from a Windows Server.

For examples of how to use **dcpromo**, see [Examples]().

## Syntax

`dcpromo [/answer[:\<filename>] | /unattend[:\<filename>] | /unattend | /adv] /uninstallBinaries [/CreateDCAccount | /UseExistingAccount:Attach] /? /?[:{Promotion | CreateDCAccount | UseExistingAccount | Demotion}]`

## Dcpromo.exe parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| /answer[:\<filename>] | Specifies an answer file that contains installation parameters and values. |
| /unattend[:\<filename>] | Specifies an answer file that contains installation parameters and values. This command provides the same function as /answer[:\<filename>]. |
| /unattend| Specifies an unattended installation in which you provide installation parameters and values at the command line. |
| /adv | Performs an install from media (IFM) operation. |
| /UninstallBinaries | Uninstalls AD DS binaries. |
| /CreateDCAccount | Creates a read-only domain controller (RODC) account. Only a member of the Domain Admins group or the Enterprise Admins group can run this command. |
| /UseExistingAccount:Attach | Attaches a server to an existing RODC account. A member of the Domain Admins group or a delegated user can run this command. |
| /? | Displays Help for Dcpromo parameters. |
| /?[:{Promotion \| CreateDCAccount \| UseExistingAccount \| Demotion}] | Displays parameters that apply to the dcpromo operation. For example, `dcpromo /?:Promotion displays` all of the parameters that you can use for a promotion operation. |

| Parameter and value pair | Description and default |
|---|---|
| AdministratorPassword:"administrator password" | Specifies a local administrator account password when AD DS is removed from a domain controller. The default is an empty password. |
| DemoteFSMO:{Yes \| \<No>} | <p>Indicates that (forced) demotion should continue, even if an operations master role is discovered on domain controller from which AD DS is being removed.</p><p>The default is **No**.</p> |
| DNSDelegationPassword {Password \| *} | Specifies the password to use for the user name (the account credentials) when you create or remove the DNS delegation. Specify `*` to prompt the user to enter credentials. |
| DNSDelegationUserName: "user_name" | Specifies the user name to use when you create or remove the DNS delegation. If you don't specify a value, then the account credentials that you specify for the AD DS installation or removal are used to for the DNS delegation. |
| IgnoreIsLastDcInDomainMismatch:{Yes \| \<No>} | <p>Used with `/IsLastDCInDomain`. This parameter specifies whether Dcpromo.exe ignores any inconsistency that it detects with the value that you specify for `/IsLastDCInDomain`. For example, if you specify `/IsLastDCInDomain:Yes` but dcpromo detects that there's actually another active domain controller in the domain, you can specify `/IgnoreIsLastDcInDomainMismatch:Yes` to have dcpromo continue the removal of AD DS from the domain controller despite the inconsistency that it has detected. Similarly, if you specify `/IsLastDCInDomain:No` but dcpromo can't detect that another domain controller is in the domain, you can specify `/IgnoreIsLastDcInDomainMismatch:Yes` to have dcpromo continue to remove AD DS from the domain controller.</p><p>The default is **No**. The default causes the wizard to prompt the user to continue and causes the command-line tool to exit with an error. |
| IgnoreIsLastDNSServerForZone:{Yes \| \<No>} | <p>Specifies whether to continue the removal of AD DS, even when the domain controller is the last DNS server for one or more of the Active Directory–integrated DNS zones that it hosts.</p><p>The default is **No**.</p> |

| Password:"password" | <p>Specifies the password that corresponds to the user name (account credentials) that is used to install the domain controller. Use this parameter with the **UserName** parameter.</p><p>Specify `*` to prompt the user to supply a password.</p> |
| RebootOnCompletion:{\<Yes> \| No} | <p>Specifies whether to restart the computer upon completion, regardless of success.</p><p>The default is **Yes**.</p> |
| RebootOnSuccess:{\<Yes> \| No \| NoAndNoPromptEither} | <p>Specifies whether to restart the computer upon successful completion.</p><p>The default is **Yes**.</p> |

| RemoveDNSDelegation:{\<Yes> \| No} | <p>Specifies whether to remove DNS delegations that point to this DNS server from the parent DNS zone.</p><p>The default is **Yes**.</p> |
| RetainDCMetadata:{Yes \| \<No>} | <p>Retains domain controller metadata in the domain after AD DS removal to allow a delegated administrator to remove AD DS from an RODC.</p><p>**The default is No**.</p> |
| UserDomain:"domain_name" | Specifies the domain name for the user name (account credentials) for the operation. This parameter also helps to specify the forest where you plan to install the domain controller or create an RODC account. If no value is specified, the domain of the computer will be used. |
| UserName:"user_name" | Specifies the user name (account credentials) for the operation. If no value is specified, the credentials of the current user are used for the operation. |

## Examples

The following example supplies an answer file named **NewForestInstallation**:

```cli
dcpromo /answer:NewForestInstallation
```

The following example creates the first domain controller in a new child domain where you expect to install at least some Windows Server 2025 domain controllers:

```cli
dcpromo /unattend /InstallDns:yes /ParentDomainDNSName:contoso.com /replicaOrNewDomain:domain /newDomain:child /newDomainDnsName:east.contoso.com /childName:east /DomainNetbiosName:east /databasePath:"e:\ntds" /logPath:"e:\ntdslogs" /sysvolpath:"g:\sysvol" /safeModeAdminPassword:FH#3573.cK /forestLevel:10 /domainLevel:10 /rebootOnCompletion:yes
```

The following example creates another domain controller with the global catalog, and it installs and configures the DNS Server service:

```cli
dcpromo /unattend /InstallDns:yes /confirmGC:yes /replicaOrNewDomain:replica /databasePath:"e:\ntds" /logPath:"e:\ntdslogs" /sysvolpath:"g:\sysvol" /safeModeAdminPassword:M6$,U8Gvx4 /rebootOnCompletion:yes
```
