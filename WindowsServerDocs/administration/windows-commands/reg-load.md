# reg load

Writes saved subkeys and entries into a different subkey in the registry. This command is intended for use with temporary files that are used for troubleshooting or editing registry entries.

## Syntax

```
reg load <keyname> <filename>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| `<keyname>` | Specifies the full path of the subkey to be loaded. To specify a remote computer, include the computer name (in the format `\\<computername>\`) as part of the *keyname*. Omitting `\\<computername>\` causes the operation to default to the local computer. The *keyname* must include a valid root key. Valid root keys for the local computer are: **HKLM**, **HKCU**, **HKCR**, **HKU**, and **HKCC**. If a remote computer is specified, valid root keys are: **HKLM** and **HKU**. If the registry key name contains a space, enclose the key name in quotes.  |
| `<filename>` | Specifies the name and path of the file to be loaded. This file must be created in advance by using the **reg save** command, and must have a .hiv extension. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

#### Remarks

- The return values for the **reg load** operation are:

    | Value | Description |
    |--|--|
    | 0 | Success |
    | 1 | Failure |

### Examples

```
reg load HKLM\TempHive TempHive.hiv
```
