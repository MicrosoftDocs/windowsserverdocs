## Syntax

```
query process [*|<processID>|<username>|<sessionname>|/id:<nn>|<programname>] [/server:<servername>]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| * | Lists the processes for all sessions. |
| `<processID>` | Specifies the numeric ID identifying the process that you want to query. |
| `<username>` | Specifies the name of the user whose processes you want to list. |
| `<sessionname>` | Specifies the name of the active session whose processes you want to list. |
| /id:`<nn>` | Specifies the ID of the session whose processes you want to list. |
| `<programname>` | Specifies the name of the program whose processes you want to query. The .exe extension is required. |
| /server:`<servername>` | Specifies the Remote Desktop Session Host server whose processes you want to list. If unspecified, the server where you are currently logged on is used. |

#### Remarks

- Administrators have full access to all **query process** functions.

- If you don't specify the <*username*>, <*sessionname*>, */id:`<nn>`*, <*programname*>, or *&#42;* parameters, this query displays only the processes that belong to the current user.

- When **query process** returns information, a greater than `(>)` symbol is displayed before each process that belongs to the current session.

## Examples

To display information about the processes being used by all sessions, type:

```
query process *
```

To display information about the processes being used by *session ID 2*, type:

```
query process /ID:2
```
