# ntbackup

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

The **ntbackup** command is not available in Windows Vista or  Windows Server 2008 . Instead, you should use the **wbadmin** command and subcommands to back up and restore your computer and files from a command prompt.
You cannot recover backups that you created with **ntbackup** by using **wbadmin**. However, a version of **ntbackup** is available as a download for  Windows Server 2008  and Windows Vista users who want to recover backups that they created using **ntbackup**. This downloadable version of **ntbackup** enables you to perform recoveries only of legacy backups, and it cannot be used on computers running  Windows Server 2008  or Windows Vista to create new backups. To download this version of **ntbackup**, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=82917](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=82917).
