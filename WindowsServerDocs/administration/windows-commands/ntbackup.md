# ntbackup

Backs up and restores your computer and files from a command prompt. This command has been replaced by the [wbadmin command](wbadmin.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **wbadmin** command can't recover backups created using the **ntbackup** command. However, a version of **ntbackup** is available as a download from [Windows NT Backup - Restore Utility](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=4220). This downloadable version helps you to perform recoveries of legacy backups, but it can't create new backups.
