# ntbackup

Backs up and restores your computer and files from a command prompt. This command has been replaced by the [wbadmin command](wbadmin.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **wbadmin** command cannot recover backups created by using the **ntbackup** commands. The Windows NT Backup - Restore utility is needed to recover from legacy backups.
