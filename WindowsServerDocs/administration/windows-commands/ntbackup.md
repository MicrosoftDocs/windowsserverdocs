# ntbackup

Applies to: Windows Server (All supported versions)

The `ntbackup` command backs up and restores your computer and files from a command prompt. This command is replaced with the [wbadmin command](wbadmin.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `wbadmin` command can't recover backups created by using the `ntbackup` commands. The Windows NT Backup - Restore utility is needed to recover from legacy backups.
