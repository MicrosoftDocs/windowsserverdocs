# Md



Creates a directory or subdirectory.

> [!NOTE]
> This command is the same as the **mkdir** command.

For examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).

## Syntax

```
md [<Drive>:]<Path>
mkdir [<Drive>:]<Path>
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|

|\<Path>|Required. Specifies the name and location of the new directory. The maximum length of any single path is determined by the file system.|
