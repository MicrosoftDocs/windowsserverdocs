# takeown

Enables an administrator to recover access to a file that previously was denied, by making the administrator the owner of the file.

For examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).

## Syntax

```
takeown [/s <Computer> [/u [<Domain>\]<User name> [/p [<Password>]]]] /f <File name> [/a] [/r [/d {Y|N}]]
```

### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|/s \<Computer>|Specifies the name or IP address of a remote computer (do not use backslashes). The default value is the local computer. This parameter applies to all of the files and folders specified in the command.|
|/u [\<Domain>\]<User name>|Runs the script with the permissions of the specified user account. The default value is system permissions.|
|/p [\<Password>]|Specifies the password of the user account that is specified in the **/u** parameter.|
|/f \<File name>|Specifies the file name or directory name pattern. You can use the wildcard character * when specifying the pattern. You can also use the syntax *ShareName*\*FileName*.|
|/a|Gives ownership to the Administrators group instead of the current user.|
|/r|Performs a recursive operation on all files in the specified directory and subdirectories.|
|/d {Y \| N}|Suppresses the confirmation prompt that is displayed when the current user does not have the "List Folder" permission on a specified directory, and instead uses the specified default value. Valid values for the **/d** option are as follows:</br>-   Y: Take ownership of the directory.</br>-   N: Skip the directory.</br>Note that you must use this option in conjunction with the **/r** option.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

## Remarks

-   This command is typically used in batch files.
-   If the **/a** parameter is not specified, file ownership is given to the user who is currently logged on to the computer.
-   Mixed patterns using (**?** and **&#42;**) are not supported by **takeown** command.
-   After deleting the lock with **takeown**, you might have to use Windows Explorer or the **cacls** command to give yourself full permissions to the files and directories before you can delete them. For more information about **cacls**, see "Additional references" at the end of this topic.
