# Windows Server Backup Command Reference



The following subcommands for **wbadmin** provide backup and recovery functionality from a command prompt.

To configure a backup schedule, you must be a member of the **Administrators** group. To perform all other tasks with this command, you must be a member of the **Backup Operators** or the **Administrators** group, or you must have been delegated the appropriate permissions.

You must run **wbadmin** from an elevated command prompt. (To open an elevated command prompt, click **Start**, right-click **Command Prompt**, and then click **Run as administrator**.)
