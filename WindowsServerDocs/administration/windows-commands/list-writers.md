# list writers

Lists writers that are on the system. If used without parameters, **list** displays the output for **list metadata** by default.

## Syntax

```
list writers [metadata | detailed | status]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| metadata | Lists the identity and status of writers, and displays metadata such as component details and excluded files. This is the default parameter. |
| detailed | Lists the same information as **metadata**, but also includes the full file list for all components. |
| status | Lists only the identity and status of registered writers. |

### Examples

To list only the identity and status of writers, type:

```
list writers status
```

Output that is similar to the following displays:

```
