tsdiscon [<SessionID> | <SessionName>] [/server:<ServerName>] [/v]
```

|-------|--------|
|\<SessionId>|Specifies the ID of the session to disconnect.|
|\<SessionName>|Specifies the name of the session to disconnect.|

## Remarks
-   You must have Full Control permission or Disconnect special access permission to disconnect another user from a session.
-   if no session ID or session name is specified, **tsdiscon** disconnects the current session.
-   Any applications that were running when you disconnected the session are automatically running when you reconnect to that session with no loss of data. Use **reset session** to end the running applications of the disconnected session, but be aware that this might result in loss of data at the session.
-   The **/server** parameter is required only if you use **tsdiscon** from a remote server.
-   The console session cannot be disconnected.
