# del



Deletes one or more files. This command is the same as the **erase** command.

For examples of how to use this command, see [Examples](#BKMK_examples).

## Syntax

```
del [/p] [/f] [/s] [/q] [/a[:]<Attributes>] <Names>
erase [/p] [/f] [/s] [/q] [/a[:]<Attributes>] <Names>
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|\<Names>|Specifies a list of one or more files or directories. Wildcards may be used to delete multiple files. If a directory is specified, all files within the directory will be deleted.|
|/p|Prompts for confirmation before deleting the specified file.|
|/f|Forces deletion of read-only files.|
|/s|Deletes specified files from the current directory and all subdirectories. Displays the names of the files as they are being deleted.|
|/q|Specifies quiet mode. You are not prompted for delete confirmation.|
|/a[:]\<Attributes>|Deletes files based on the following file attributes:</br>**r** Read-only files</br>**h** Hidden files</br>**i** Not content indexed files</br>**s** System files</br>**a** Files ready for archiving</br>**l** Reparse points</br>-  Prefix meaning 'not'|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

## Remarks

> [!CAUTION]
> If you use **del** to delete a file from your disk, you cannot retrieve it.
> -   If you use **/p**, **del** displays the name of a file and sends the following message:

    `FileName, Delete (Y/N)?`

    To confirm the deletion, press Y. To cancel the deletion and display the next file name (that is, if you specified a group of files), press N. To stop the **del** command, press CTRL+C.
- If you disable command extensions, **/s** displays the names of any files that were not found instead of displaying the names of files that are being deleted (that is, the behavior is reversed).
- If you specify a folder in *Names*, all of the files in the folder are deleted. For example, the following command deletes all of the files in the \Work folder:  
  ```
  del \work
  ```  
- You can use wildcards (**&#42;** and **?**) to delete more than one file at a time. However, to avoid deleting files unintentionally, you should use wildcards cautiously with the **del** command. For example, if you type the following command:  
  ```
  del *.*
  ```  
  The **del** command displays the following prompt:

  `Are you sure (Y/N)?`

  To delete all of the files in the current directory, press Y and then press ENTER. To cancel the deletion, press N and then press ENTER.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you use wildcard characters with the **del** command, use the same wildcard characters with the **dir** command to list all the files that will be deleted.
> -   The **del** command, with different parameters, is available from the Recovery Console.
