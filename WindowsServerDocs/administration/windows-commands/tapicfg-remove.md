# tapicfg remove

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Removes a TAPI application directory partition.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be a member of the Enterprise Admins group in active directory to run this command.

## Syntax

```
tapicfg remove /directory:<partitionname>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| remove `/directory:<partitionname>` | Required. Specifies the DNS name of the TAPI application directory partition to be removed. Note that this name must be a fully-qualified domain name. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

#### Remarks

- This command-line tool can be run on any computer that is a member of the domain.

- User-supplied text (such as the names of TAPI application directory partitions, servers, and domains) with International or Unicode characters are only displayed correctly if appropriate fonts and language support are installed.

- You can still use Internet Locator Service (ILS) servers in your organization, if ILS is needed to support certain applications, because TAPI clients running Windows XP or a Windows Server 2003 operating system can query either ILS servers or TAPI application directory partitions.

- You can use **tapicfg** to create or remove service connection points. If the TAPI application directory partition is renamed for any reason (for example, if you rename the domain in which it resides), you must remove the existing service connection point and create a new one that contains the new DNS name of the TAPI application directory partition to be published. Otherwise, TAPI clients are unable to locate and access the TAPI application directory partition. You can also remove a service connection point for maintenance or security purposes (for example, if you do not want to expose TAPI data on a specific TAPI application directory partition).
