# diskcomp

Compares the contents of two floppy disks. If used without parameters, **diskcomp** uses the current drive to compare both disks.

## Syntax

```
diskcomp [<drive1>: [<drive2>:]]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `<drive1>` | Specifies the drive containing one of the floppy disks. |
| /? | Displays help at the command prompt. |

#### Remarks

- The **diskcomp** command works only with floppy disks. You cannot use **diskcomp** with a hard disk. If you specify a hard disk drive for *drive1* or *drive2*, **diskcomp** displays the following error message:

  ```
  Invalid drive specification
  Specified drive does not exist
  or is nonremovable
  ```

- If all tracks on the two disks being compared are the same (it ignores a disk's volume number), **diskcomp** displays the following message:

  ```
  Compare OK
  ```

  If the tracks aren't the same, **diskcomp** displays a message similar to the following:

  ```
  Compare error on
  side 1, track 2
  ```

  When **diskcomp** completes the comparison, it displays the following message:

  ```
  Compare another diskette (Y/N)?
  ```

  If you press **Y**, **diskcomp** prompts you to insert the disk for the next comparison. If you press **N**, **diskcomp** stops the comparison.

- If you omit the *drive2* parameter, **diskcomp** uses the current drive for *drive2*. If you omit both drive parameters, **diskcomp** uses the current drive for both. If the current drive is the same as *drive1*, **diskcomp** prompts you to swap disks as necessary.

- If you specify the same floppy disk drive for *drive1* and *drive2*, **diskcomp** compares them by using one drive and prompts you to insert the disks as necessary. You might have to swap the disks more than once, depending on the capacity of the disks and the amount of available memory.

- **Diskcomp** can't compare a single-sided disk with a double-sided disk, nor a high-density disk with a double-density disk. If the disk in *drive1* isn't of the same type as the disk in *drive2*, **diskcomp** displays the following message:

  ```
  Drive types or diskette types not compatible
  ```

- **Diskcomp** doesn't work on a network drive or on a drive created by the **subst** command. If you attempt to use **diskcomp** with a drive of any of these types, **diskcomp** displays the following error message:

  ```
  Invalid drive specification
  ```

- If you use **diskcomp** with a disk that you made by using **copy**, **diskcomp** might display a message similar to the following:

  ```
  Compare error on
  side 0, track 0
  ```

  This type of error can occur even if the files on the disks are identical. Although **copy** duplicates information, it doesn't necessarily place it in the same location on the destination disk.

- **diskcomp** exit codes:

  | Exit code | Description |
  | --------- | ----------- |
  | 0 | Disks are the same |
  | 1 | Differences were found |
  | 3 | Hard error occurred |
  | 4 | Initialization error occurred |

  To process exit codes that are returned by **diskcomp**, you can use the *ERRORLEVEL* environment variable on the **if** command line in a batch program.

## Examples

If your computer has only one floppy disk drive (for example, drive A), and you want to compare two disks, type:

```
diskcomp a: a:
```

**Diskcomp** prompts you to insert each disk, as needed.

To illustrates how to process a **diskcomp** exit code in a batch program that uses the *ERRORLEVEL* environment variable on the **if** command line:

```
rem Checkout.bat compares the disks in drive A and B
echo off
diskcomp a: b:
if errorlevel 4 goto ini_error
if errorlevel 3 goto hard_error
if errorlevel 1 goto no_compare
if errorlevel 0 goto compare_ok
:ini_error
echo ERROR: Insufficient memory or command invalid
goto exit
:hard_error
echo ERROR: An irrecoverable error occurred
goto exit
:break
echo You just pressed CTRL+C to stop the comparison
goto exit
:no_compare
echo Disks are not the same
goto exit
:compare_ok
echo The comparison was successful; the disks are the same
goto exit
:exit
```
