# where



Displays the location of files that match the given search pattern.



## Syntax

```
where [/r <Dir>] [/q] [/f] [/t] [$<ENV>:|<Path>:]<Pattern>[ ...]
```

### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|/r \<Dir>|Indicates a recursive search, starting with the specified directory.|
|/q|Returns an exit code (**0** for success, **1** for failure) without displaying the list of matched files.|
|/f|Displays the results of the **where** command in quotation marks.|
|/t|Displays the file size and the last modified date and time of each matched file.|
|[$\<ENV>:\|\<Path>:]\<Pattern>[ ...]|Specifies the search pattern for the files to match. At least one pattern is required, and the pattern can include wildcard characters (**&#42;** and **?**). By default, **where** searches the current directory and the paths that are specified in the PATH environment variable. You can specify a different path to search by using the format $*ENV*:*Pattern* (where *ENV* is an existing environment variable containing one or more paths) or by using the format *Path*:*Pattern* (where *Path* is the directory path you want to search). These optional formats should not be used with the **/r** command-line option.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

## Remarks

-   If you do not specify a file name extension, the extensions listed in the PATHEXT environment variable are appended to the pattern by default.
-   **Where** can run recursive searches, display file information such as date or size, and accept environment variables in place of paths on local computers.

## Examples

To find all files named Test in drive C of the current computer and its subdirectories, type:
```
where /r c:\ test
```
To list all files in the Public directory, type:
```
where $public:*.*
```
To find all files named Notepad in drive C of the remote computer, Computer1, and its subdirectories, type:
```
where /r \\computer1\c notepad.*
```
