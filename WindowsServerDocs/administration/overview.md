## Management tools

The primary tools for managing your Windows Server infrastructure are:

- Windows Admin Center
- Local management tools
- Azure Arc
- System Center

You're probably already familiar with some of these tools, like the Windows Server Microsoft Management Console (MMC). However, it's important to be familiar with all the management tools Windows Server offers so you can choose which one is right for your organization.

This article walks you through each one, describing their capabilities, and gives you resources to download and configure them.

### [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windows-admin-center)

Windows Admin Center is a set of browser-based server administration tools that gives you full control over all aspects of your server infrastructure. It lets you configure deeper and more advanced administration features for your Windows Server and cluster deployments. You can locally deploy Windows Admin Center without using Azure or the cloud, or you can directly integrate it into the Azure portal. It's also useful for managing servers on private networks that aren't connected to the Internet.

Windows Admin Center is the modern evolution of in-box management tools, such as Server Manager and Microsoft Management Consoles (MMC), that complements other management solutions.

Here's a brief summary of the capabilities of Windows Admin Center:

- Covers single Windows Server deployments or hyperconverged clusters.
- Includes a web browser-based interface.
- Supports disconnected mode.
- Focused on general server management, role configuration, and troubleshooting.

If you're interested in learning more about Windows Admin Center, see [What is Windows Admin Center](../manage/windows-admin-center/understand/what-is.md).

### When to use Windows Admin Center

You can use Windows Admin Center when you want to:

- Manage your servers and clusters with modernized versions of familiar tools, such as Server Manager.
- Integrate your system with Azure to connect your on-premises servers with relevant cloud services with Azure Arc.
- Streamline management of Azure Local or Windows Server hyperconverged clusters.
- Use simplified workloads to create and manage VMs, Storage Spaces Direct volumes, Software-Defined Networking, and so on.

To get started using Windows Admin Center, [download Windows Admin Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-admin-center), then follow [the installation instructions](../manage/windows-admin-center/deploy/install.md). Once you're set up, learn how to start using Windows Admin Center at [Get started with Windows Admin Center](../manage/windows-admin-center/use/get-started.md).

### [Local management tools](#tab/local-management-tools)

Windows Server comes with many local tools that let you manage your environment. These tools include:

- [Server Manager](server-manager/server-manager.md)
- [PowerShell](/powershell/windows/get-started)
- [Windows commands](windows-commands/windows-commands.md)
- [Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)](../remote/remote-server-administration-tools.md)

Use these tools to analyze your Windows Server environment, manage specific servers, fine-tune performance, troubleshoot issues, and automate management tasks.

Here's a brief summary of what the local management tools for your Windows Server environment can do:

- Covers single-server deployments and deployments with fewer servers.
- Includes a GUI and command-line interface.
- Support for disconnected mode.
- Focused on general server management, role configuration, and troubleshooting.

### When to use local management tools

You can use local management tools for Windows Server in the following situations:

- You're an IT professional who wants a straightforward management console to manage local and remote Windows servers.
- You want to use Win32 console commands to run scripts or scripting tools to automate tasks.
- You want to use PowerShell to automate management for Windows Server and other systems.
- You want to use SConfig to manage Windows Server Core.

### [System Center](#tab/system-center)

System Center is for datacenter-scale management, and lets you control IT infrastructure across your environment and platforms. You can simplify deployment, configuration, management, and monitoring for infrastructure and virtualized software-defined datacenters. Using System Center can also increase your system's overall agility and performance.

Here's a brief summary of the capabilities of System Center:

- Covers the entire datacenter, or multi-server management.
- Includes both a GUI and command-line tools.
- Supports disconnected mode.
- Focused on day-to-day operations.

### When to use System Center

You can use System Center when you want to:

- Use Operations Manager for flexible, cost-effective, and comprehensive infrastructure monitoring for your datacenters and private cloud.
- Use Data Protection Manager for your enterprise's disaster recovery strategy.
- Use Virtual Machine Manager to create a unified management experience across both your on-premises datacenters and virtualized workloads.

### [Azure Arc](#tab/azure-arc)

Azure Arc provides cloud-based management for servers. When you enable Azure Arc, you can manage physical servers running Windows, or Linux and virtual machines (VMs) even if they're hosted outside of Azure on your corporate network or another cloud provider. The management experience is seamless, so it feels like managing native Azure virtual machines. You can manage, govern, and secure your Windows Servers with services such as Azure Policy, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Monitor, and Azure Update Management.

Azure Automanage offers a unified solution to simplify IT management of Windows Server and Linux servers in Azure or in hybrid environments enabled by Azure Arc.

Here's a brief summary of the capabilities of Azure Arc and Azure Automanage:

- Scale across Windows and Linux servers.
- Provide web-based browser interface, REST API, and command-line tools.
- Offer limited support for disconnected mode.
- Focused on at-scale governance, security, monitoring, and reducing operating expenses.

To learn more about Azure Arc, see [What is an Azure Arc-enabled server](/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview).

### When to use Azure Arc

You can use Azure Arc and Azure Automanage when you want to:

- Monitor the operating system (OS) and workloads running on your machines.
- Manage your system using Automation runbooks or solutions like Update Management.
- Secure your Windows Server using Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- Use Azure Policy Guest Configuration to govern your Windows Server machines.
