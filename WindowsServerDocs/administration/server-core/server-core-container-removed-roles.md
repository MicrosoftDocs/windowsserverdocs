# Roles, Role Services, and Features not in Server Core containers - Windows Server, version 1803

> Applies to: Windows Server, version 1803

In Windows Server, version 1803, we've [reduced the overall size of the Server Core container image to **1.58 GB**](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/virtualization/2018/01/22/a-smaller-windows-server-core-container-with-better-application-compatibility/). The way we've done this is by optimizing the architecture and removing things you don't need in a [Server Core container](/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/). Some were things that didn't work in containers, some were roles and features no one's been using.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We removed these from the Server Core **container** image, not [Server Core itself](server-core-roles-and-services.md).

Here's the complete list of features and roles removed from the Server Core container image:
