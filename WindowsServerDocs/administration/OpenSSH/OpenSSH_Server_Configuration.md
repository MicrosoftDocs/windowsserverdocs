# OpenSSH Server Configuration for Windows 10 1809 and Windows Server 2019

This topic covers the Windows-specific configuration for OpenSSH Server (sshd).

OpenSSH maintains detailed documentation for configuration options online at [OpenSSH.com](https://www.openssh.com/manual.html), which is not duplicated in this documentation set.

## Configuring the default shell for OpenSSH in Windows

The default command shell provides the experience a user sees when connecting to the server using SSH.
The initial default Windows is the Windows Command shell (cmd.exe).
Windows also includes PowerShell and Bash, and third-party command shells are also available for Windows and may be configured as the default shell for a server.

To set the default command shell, first confirm that the OpenSSH installation folder is on the system path.
For Windows, the default installation folder is SystemDrive:WindowsDirectory\System32\openssh.
The following command shows the current path setting, and add the default OpenSSH installation folder to it.

Command shell | Command to use
------------- | --------------
Command | path
PowerShell | $env:path

Configuring the default ssh shell is done in the Windows registry by adding the full path to the shell executable to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH in the string value DefaultShell.

As an example, the following PowerShell command sets the default shell to be powershell.exe:

```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH" -Name DefaultShell -Value "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -PropertyType String -Force
```

## Windows Configurations in sshd_config

In Windows, sshd reads configuration data from %programdata%\ssh\sshd_config by default, or a different configuration file may be specified by launching sshd.exe with the -f parameter.
If the file is absent, sshd generates one with the default configuration when the service is started.

The elements listed below provide Windows-specific configuration possible through entries in sshd_config.
There are other configuration settings possible in that are not listed here, as they are covered in detail in the online [Win32 OpenSSH documentation](https://github.com/powershell/win32-openssh/wiki).

### AllowGroups, AllowUsers, DenyGroups, DenyUsers

Controlling which users and groups can connect to the server is done using the AllowGroups, AllowUsers, DenyGroups and DenyUsers directives.
The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order: DenyUsers, AllowUsers, DenyGroups, and finally AllowGroups.
All account names must be specified in lower case.
See PATTERNS in ssh_config for more information on patterns for wildcards.

When configuring user/group based rules with a domain user or group, use the following format: ``` user?domain* ```.
Windows allows multiple of formats for specifying domain principals, but many conflict with standard Linux patterns.
For that reason, * is added to cover FQDNs.
Also, this approach uses "?", instead of @, to avoid conflicts with the username@host format.

Work group users/groups and internet-connected accounts are always resolved to their local account name (no domain part, similar to standard Unix names).
Domain users and groups are strictly resolved to [NameSamCompatible](/windows/desktop/api/secext/ne-secext-extended_name_format) format - domain_short_name\user_name.
All user/group based configuration rules need to adhere to this format.

Examples for domain users and groups

```
DenyUsers contoso\admin@192.168.2.23 : blocks contoso\admin from 192.168.2.23
DenyUsers contoso\* : blocks all users from contoso domain
AllowGroups contoso\sshusers : only allow users from contoso\sshusers group
```

Examples for local users and groups

```
AllowUsers localuser@192.168.2.23
AllowGroups sshusers
```

### AuthenticationMethods

For Windows OpenSSH, the only available authentication methods are "password" and "publickey".

### AuthorizedKeysFile

The default is ".ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2". If the path is not absolute, it is taken relative to user's home directory (or profile image path). Ex. c:\users\user. Note that if the user belongs to the administrator group, %programdata%/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys is used instead.

### ChrootDirectory (Support added in v7.7.0.0)

This directive is only supported with sftp sessions. A remote session into cmd.exe wouldn't honor this. To set up a sftp-only chroot server, set ForceCommand to internal-sftp. You may also set up scp with chroot, by implementing a custom shell that would only allow scp and sftp.

### HostKey

The defaults are %programdata%/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key, %programdata%/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key, %programdata%/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key, and %programdata%/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key. If the defaults are not present, sshd automatically generates these on a service start.

### Match

Note that pattern rules in this section. User and group names should be in lower case.

### PermitRootLogin

Not applicable in Windows. To prevent administrator login, use Administrators with DenyGroups directive.

### SyslogFacility

If you need file based logging, use LOCAL0. Logs are generated under %programdata%\ssh\logs.
For any other value, including the default value, AUTH directs logging to ETW. For more info, see [Logging Facilities in Windows](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Logging-Facilities).
