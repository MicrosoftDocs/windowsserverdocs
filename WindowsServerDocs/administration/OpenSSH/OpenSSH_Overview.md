# OpenSSH for Windows overview

>Applies to Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows 10 (build 1809 and later)

OpenSSH is the open-source version of the Secure Shell (SSH) tools used by administrators of Linux and other non-Windows for cross-platform management of remote systems. OpenSSH has been added to Windows (as of autumn 2018), and is included in Windows Server and Windows client.

SSH is based on a client-server architecture where the system the user is working on is the client and the remote system being managed is the server. OpenSSH includes a range of components and tools designed to provide a secure and straightforward approach to remote system administration.

OpenSSH for Windows has the below commands built in.

- ssh is the SSH client component that runs on the user's local system
- sshd is the SSH server component that must be running on the system being managed remotely
- ssh-keygen generates, manages and converts authentication keys for SSH
- ssh-agent stores private keys used for public key authentication
- ssh-add adds private keys to the list allowed by the server
- ssh-keyscan aids in collecting the public SSH host keys from hosts
- sftp is the service that provides the Secure File Transfer Protocol, and runs over SSH
- scp is a file copy utility that runs on SSH
