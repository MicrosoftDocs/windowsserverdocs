# OpenSSH in Windows

OpenSSH is the open-source version of the Secure Shell (SSH) tools used by administrators of Linux and other non-Windows for cross-platform management of remote systems. OpenSSH has been added to Windows (as of autumn 2018), and is included in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019.

SSH is based on a client-server architecture where the system the user is working on is the client and the remote system being managed is the server. OpenSSH includes a range of components and tools designed to provide a secure and straightforward approach to remote system administration, including:

* sshd.exe, which is the SSH server component that must be running on the system being managed remotely
* ssh.exe, which is the SSH client component that runs on the user's local system
* ssh-keygen.exe generates, manages and converts authentication keys for SSH
* ssh-agent.exe stores private keys used for public key authentication
* ssh-add.exe adds private keys to the list allowed by the server
* ssh-keyscan.exe aids in collecting the public SSH host keys from a number of hosts
* sftp.exe is the service that provides the Secure File Transfer Protocol, and runs over SSH
* scp.exe is a file copy utility that runs on SSH

Documentation in this section focuses on how OpenSSH is used on Windows, including installation, and Windows-specific configuration and use cases.

* Additional detailed documentation for common OpenSSH features is available online at [OpenSSH.com](https://www.openssh.com/manual.html).

* The master [OpenSSH open source project](https://www.openssh.com) is managed by developers at the OpenBSD Project. The Microsoft fork of this project is in [GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/openssh-portable).
Feedback on Windows OpenSSH is welcomed and can be provided by creating GitHub issues in our [OpenSSH GitHub repo](https://github.com/PowerShell/openssh-portable).
