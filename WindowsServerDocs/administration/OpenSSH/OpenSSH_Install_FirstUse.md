# Get started with OpenSSH for Windows

>Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows 11, Windows 10

OpenSSH is a connectivity tool for remote sign-in that uses the SSH protocol. It encrypts all traffic between client and server to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks.

An OpenSSH-compatible client can be used to connect to Windows Server and Windows client devices.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you downloaded the OpenSSH beta from the GitHub repo at [PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH), follow the instructions listed there, not the ones in this article. Some information in the Win32-OpenSSH repository relates to prerelease product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided there.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, your computer must meet the following requirements:

- A device running at least Windows Server 2019 or Windows 10 (build 1809).
- PowerShell 5.1 or later.
- An account that is a member of the built-in Administrators group.

### Prerequisites check

To validate your environment, open an elevated PowerShell session and do the following:

- Type _winver.exe_ and press enter to see the version details for your Windows device.
- Run `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`. Verify your major version is at least 5, and your minor version at least 1. Learn more about [installing PowerShell on Windows](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows).
- Run the command below. The output shows `True` when you're a member of the built-in Administrators group.

  ```powershell
  (New-Object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal([Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent())).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> Installing OpenSSH Server will create and enable a firewall rule named `OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP`. This allows inbound SSH traffic on port 22. If this rule is not enabled and this port is not open, connections will be refused or reset.

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To install OpenSSH using PowerShell, run PowerShell as an Administrator.
To make sure that OpenSSH is available, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH*'
```

The command should return the following output if neither are already installed:

```Output
Name  : OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent

Name  : OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
State : NotPresent
```

Then, install the server or client components as needed:

```powershell
# Install the OpenSSH Client
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0

# Install the OpenSSH Server
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
```

Both commands should return the following output:

```Output
Path          :
Online        : True
RestartNeeded : False
```

To start and configure OpenSSH Server for initial use, open an elevated PowerShell prompt (right click, Run as an administrator), then run the following commands to start the `sshd service`:

```powershell
# Start the sshd service
Start-Service sshd

# OPTIONAL but recommended:
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'

# Confirm the Firewall rule is configured. It should be created automatically by setup. Run the following to verify
if (!(Get-NetFirewallRule -Name "OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Name, Enabled)) {
    Write-Output "Firewall Rule 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' does not exist, creating it..."
    New-NetFirewallRule -Name 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (sshd)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22
} else {
    Write-Output "Firewall rule 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' has been created and exists."
}
```

## Connect to OpenSSH Server

Once installed, you can connect to OpenSSH Server from a Windows or Windows Server device with the OpenSSH client installed. From a PowerShell prompt, run the following command.

```powershell
ssh domain\username@servername
```

Once connected, you get a message similar to the following output.

```Output
The authenticity of host 'servername (10.00.00.001)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:(<a large string>).
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

Entering _yes_ adds that server to the list of known SSH hosts on your Windows client.

At this point, you'll be prompted for your password. As a security precaution, your password won't be displayed as you type.

Once connected, you'll see the Windows command shell prompt:

```Output
domain\username@SERVERNAME C:\Users\username>
```

## Uninstall OpenSSH for Windows

# [GUI](#tab/gui)

To uninstall OpenSSH using Windows Settings:

1. Open **Settings**, select **System**, then select **Optional Features** (also referred to as **Manage optional features**).
1. In the list, select **OpenSSH Client** or **OpenSSH Server**.
1. Select **Uninstall**.

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To uninstall the OpenSSH components using PowerShell, use the following commands:

```powershell
# Uninstall the OpenSSH Client
Remove-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0

# Uninstall the OpenSSH Server
Remove-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
```

You may need to restart Windows afterwards if the service was in use at the time it was uninstalled.
