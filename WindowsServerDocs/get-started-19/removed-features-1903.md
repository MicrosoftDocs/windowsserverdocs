# Features removed or planned for replacement starting with Windows Server, version 1903 and 1909

>Applies to: Windows Server, version 1903 and 1909

The following is a list of features and functionalities in Windows Server, version 1903 and 1909 that have either been removed from the product in that release or are starting to be considered for potential replacement in subsequent releases. It is intended for IT professionals who are updating operating systems in a commercial environment. **This list is subject to change in subsequent releases and might not include every affected feature or functionality.**

Also see [Features removed or planned for replacement in Windows Server](removed-features.md).

## Features we're no longer developing

We're no longer actively developing these features and may remove them from a future update. Some features have been replaced with other features or functionality, while others are now available from different sources. 

If you have feedback about the proposed replacement of any of these features, you can use the [Feedback Hub app](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app).

Instead, it must be bound via [Switch Embedded Teaming (SET)](../virtualization/hyper-v-virtual-switch/rdma-and-switch-embedded-teaming.md#switch-embedded-teaming-set).                                                                                                                                                                    |

The support for Windows 2000 Display Driver Model (XDDM) based remote display drivers will be removed in a future release. Independent Software Vendors that use XDDM-based remote display driver should plan a migration to the WDDM driver model.

| Host Guardian Service Active Directory attestation mode | We're no longer developing Host Guardian Service Active Directory attestation mode - instead we've added a new attestation mode, [host key attestation](../security/guarded-fabric-shielded-vm/guarded-fabric-create-host-key.md), that's far simpler and equally as compatible as Active Directory based attestation.  This new mode provides equivalent functionality with a setup experience, simpler management and fewer infrastructure dependencies than the Active Directory attestation. Host key attestation has no additional hardware requirements beyond what Active Directory attestation required, so all existing systems will remain compatible with the new mode. See [Deploy guarded hosts](../security/guarded-fabric-shielded-vm/guarded-fabric-configure-hgs-with-authorized-hyper-v-hosts.md) for more information about your attestation options. |
