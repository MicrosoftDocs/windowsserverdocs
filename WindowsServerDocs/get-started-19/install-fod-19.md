# Server Core App Compatibility Feature on Demand (FOD)

> Applies to: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel

The **Server Core App Compatibility Feature on Demand** is an optional feature package that can be added to Windows Server 2019 Server Core installations, or Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel, at any time.

For more information on Features on Demand (FOD), see [Features On Demand](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/features-on-demand-v2--capabilities).

## Why install the App Compatibility FOD?

App Compatibility, a Feature on Demand for Server Core, significantly improves the app compatibility of the Windows Server Core installation option by including a subset of binaries and packages from Windows Server with Desktop Experience, without adding the Windows Server Desktop Experience graphical environment. This optional package is available on a separate ISO, or from Windows Update, but can only be added to Windows Server Core installations and images.

The two primary values the App Compatibility FOD provides are:

- Increases the compatibility of Server Core for server applications that are already in market or have already been developed by organizations and deployed.
- Assists with providing OS components and increased app compatibility of software tools used in acute troubleshooting and debugging scenarios.

Operating system components that are available as part of the Server Core App Compatibility FOD include:

-   Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe)

-   Event Viewer (Eventvwr.msc)

-   Performance Monitor (PerfMon.exe)

-   Resource Monitor (Resmon.exe)

-   Device Manager (Devmgmt.msc)

-   File Explorer (Explorer.exe)

-   Windows PowerShell (Powershell_ISE.exe)

-   Disk Management (Diskmgmt.msc)

-   Failover Cluster Manager (CluAdmin.msc)

    -   Requires addition of the Failover Clustering Windows Server feature first.

        -   From an elevated PowerShell session:

            ```PowerShell
            Install-WindowsFeature -Name Failover-Clustering -IncludeManagementTools
            ```

        -   To run Failover Cluster Manager, enter **cluadmin** at the command prompt.

Servers running Windows Server, version 1903 and later also support the following components (when using the same version of the App Compatibility FOD):

- Hyper-V Manager (virtmgmt.msc)
- Task Scheduler (taskschd.msc)

## Installing the App Compatibility FOD

The App Compatibility FOD can only be installed on Server Core. Don't attempt to add the Server Core App Compatibility FOD to a Windows Server installation of Windows Server with Desktop Experience. The same FOD optional packages ISO can be used for either Windows Server 2019 Server Core installations, or Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel installations.

1. If the server can connect to Windows Update, all you have to do is run the following command from an elevated PowerShell session and then restart Windows Server after the command finishes running:

    ```PowerShell
    Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name ServerCore.AppCompatibility~~~~0.0.1.0
    ```

2. If the server can't connect to Windows Update, instead download the Server FOD optional packages ISO, and copy the ISO to a shared folder on your local network:

   - If you have a volume license you can download the Server FOD ISO image file from the same portal where the OS ISO image file is obtained: [Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).
   - The Server FOD ISO image file is also available on the [Microsoft Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server) or on the [Visual Studio portal](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) for subscribers.

3. Sign in with an administrator account on the Server Core computer that is connected to your local network and that you want to add the FOD to.

4. Use **net use**, or some other method, to connect to the location of the FOD ISO.

5. Copy the FOD ISO to a local folder of your choosing.

6. Mount the FOD ISO by using the following command in an elevated PowerShell session:

    ```PowerShell
    Mount-DiskImage -ImagePath drive_letter:\folder_where_ISO_is_saved\ISO_filename.iso
    ```

7. Run the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name ServerCore.AppCompatibility~~~~0.0.1.0 -Source <Mounted_Server_FOD_Drive> -LimitAccess
     ```

8. After the progress bar completes, restart the operating system.

## To optionally add Internet Explorer 11 to Server Core (after adding the Server Core App Compatibility FOD)

 >[!NOTE]
   > The Server Core App Compatibility FOD is required for the addition of Internet Explorer 11, but Internet Explorer 11 is not required to add the Server Core App Compatibility FOD.

1. Sign in as Administrator on the Server Core computer that has the App Compatibility FOD already added and the Server FOD optional package ISO copied locally.

2. Start PowerShell by entering **powershell.exe** at a command prompt.

3. Mount the FOD ISO by using the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Mount-DiskImage -ImagePath drive_letter:\folder_where_ISO_is_saved\ISO_filename.iso
    ```

4. Run the following command, using the `$package_path` variable to enter the path to the Internet Explorer cab file:

    ```PowerShell
    $package_path = D:\Microsoft-Windows-InternetExplorer-Optional-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~.cab

    Add-WindowsPackage -Online -PackagePath $package_path
    ```

5. After the progress bar completes, restart the operating system.

## Release notes and suggestions for the Server Core App Compatibility FOD and Internet Explorer 11 optional package

> [!IMPORTANT]
> FODs installed on Windows Server, version 1809 won't remain in place after an in-place upgrade to Windows Server, version 1903, so you'd have to install them again after the upgrade. Alternatively, you can add FODs to the new Windows Server installation source prior to upgrading. This ensures that the new version of any FODs are present after the upgrade completes. For more info, see the [Adding capabilities and optional packages to an offline WIM Server Core image](install-fod-19.md#add-capabilities).

- **Important:** Read the Windows Server 2019 release notes for any issues, considerations, or guidance before proceeding with installation and use of the Server Core App Compatibility FOD and Internet Explorer 11 optional package.

- It's possible to encounter flickering with the Server Core console experience when adding the App Compatibility FOD after using Windows Update to install cumulative updates.  This issue is resolved with December, 2018 updates.  For more info and resolution steps, see [Knowledge Base article 4481610: Screen flickers after you install Server Core App Compatibility FOD in Windows Server 2019 Server Core](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4481610/screen-flickers-after-fod-installation-windows2019-server-core).

- After installation of the App Compatibility FOD and reboot of the server, the command console window frame color will change to a different shade of blue.

- If you choose to also install the Internet Explorer 11 optional package, note that double clicking to open locally saved .htm files is not supported. However, you can **right-click** and choose **Open with IE**, or you can open it directly from Internet Explorer **File** -> **Open**.

- To further enhance the app compatibility of Server Core with the App Compatibility FOD, the IIS Management Console has been added to Server Core as an optional component.  However, it is absolutely necessary to first add the App Compatibility FOD to use the IIS Management Console. IIS Management Console relies on the Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe), which is only available on Server Core with the addition of the App Compatibility FOD.  Use Powershell [**Install-WindowsFeature**](/powershell/module/microsoft.windows.servermanager.migration/install-windowsfeature) to add IIS Management Console.

- As a general point of guidance, when installing apps on Server Core (with or without these optional packages) it is sometimes necessary to use silent install options and instructions.

  - As an example, SQL Server Management Studio for SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017 can be installed on Server Core and is fully functional when the App Compatibility FOD is present.  See, [Install SQL Server from the Command Prompt](/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt?view=sql-server-2017&preserve-view=true).
  - If SQL Server Management Studio is not desired, then it is unnecessary to install the Server Core App Compatibility FOD.  See, [Install SQL Server on Server Core](/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-on-server-core?view=sql-server-2017&preserve-view=true).

## <a id=add-capabilities> Adding capabilities and optional packages to an offline WIM Server Core image

1. Download the Windows Server and Server FOD ISO image files to a local folder on a Windows computer.

   - If you have a volume license you can download the Windows Server and Server FOD ISO image files from the [Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).
   - The Server FOD ISO image file is also available for Long-Term Servicing Channel releases on the [Microsoft Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server) or on the [Visual Studio portal](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) for subscribers.

2. Open a PowerShell session as an administrator and then use the following commands to mount the image files as drives:

   ```PowerShell
   Mount-DiskImage -ImagePath Path_To_ServerFOD_ISO
   Mount-DiskImage -ImagePath Path_To_Windows_Server_ISO
   ```

3. Copy the contents of the Windows Server ISO file to a local folder (for example, *C:\SetupFiles\WindowsServer*).

4. Get the image name you want to modify within the Install.wim file by using the following command.<br>
Use the `$install_wim_path` variable to enter the path to the Install.wim file, located inside the \Sources folder of the ISO file.

   ```PowerShell
   $install_wim_path = C:\SetupFiles\WindowsServer\sources\install.wim

   Get-WindowsImage -ImagePath $install_wim_path
   ```

5. Mount the Install.wim file in a new folder by using the following command replacing the sample variable values with your own, and reusing the `$install_wim_path` variable from the previous command.<br>

   - `$image_name` - Enter the name of the image you want to mount.
   - `$mount_folder variable` - Specify the folder to use when accessing the contents of the Install.wim file.

   ```PowerShell
   $image_name = Windows Server Datacenter
   $mount_folder = c:\test\offline

   Mount-WindowsImage -ImagePath $install_wim_path -Name $image_name -path $mount_folder
   ```

6. Add capabilities and packages you want to the mounted Install.wim image by using the following commands, replacing the sample variable values with your own.<br>

   - `$capability_name` - Specify the name of the capability to install (in this case, the AppCompatibility capability).
   - `$package_path` - Specify the path to the package to install (in this case, Internet Explorer).
   - `$fod_drive` - Specify the drive letter of the mounted Server FOD image.

   ```PowerShell
   $capability_name = ServerCore.AppCompatibility~~~~0.0.1.0
   $package_path = D:\Microsoft-Windows-InternetExplorer-Optional-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~.cab
   $fod_drive = d:\

   Add-WindowsCapability -Path $mount_folder -Name $capability_name -Source $fod_drive -LimitAccess
   Add-WindowsPackage -Path $mount_folder -PackagePath $package_path
   ```

7. Dismount and commit changes to the Install.wim file by using the following command, which uses the `$mount_folder` variable from previous commands:

   ```PowerShell
   Dismount-WindowsImage -Path $mount_folder -Save
   ```

You can now upgrade your server by running setup.exe from the folder you created for the Windows Server installation files (in this example: *C:\SetupFiles\WindowsServer*). This folder now contains the Windows Server installation files with the additional capabilities and optional packages included.
