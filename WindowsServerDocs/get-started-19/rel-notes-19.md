# Release Notes - Important issues in Windows Server 2019

>Applies To: Windows Server 2019

These release notes summarize the most critical issues in the Windows Server 2019 operating system, including ways to avoid or work around the issues, if known. For information about by-design changes, new features, and fixes in this release, see [What's New in Windows Server 2019](whats-new-19.md) and announcements from the specific feature teams. Unless otherwise specified, each reported issue applies to all editions and installation options of Windows Server 2019.

This document is continuously updated. As critical issues requiring a workaround are discovered, they are added, as are new workarounds and fixes as they become available.

## Release Notes

The following known issues are present in Windows Server 2019.

| Title         | Description                            |
| -----         | -----------                            |
| Installation option menu during server setup has truncated German text | When running setup from German server media, on the operating system selection window titled, “Select the operating system you want to install,” the description for Desktop Experience installation options will have missing and incorrect characters at the very end of the sentence. Here is the full German text as it should appear.<br/>      <br/>`Durch diese Option wird die vollständige grafische Umgebung von Windows installiert, wodurch zusätzlicher Speicherplatz verbraucht wird. Sie kann hilfreich sein, wenn Sie den Windows-Desktop verwenden möchten oder über eine App verfügen, die die grafische Umgebung benötigt.` <br><br>This only impacts the German media released at Public Availability of Windows Server 2019, Windows Server, version 1809, and Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2019.|
| Windows Server branding image incorrect during setup of Windows Server, version 1809 | During the setup experience for Windows Server, version 1809, the background image on some initial screens shows &quot;Windows Server 2019&quot;.  As with Windows Server, versions 1709 and 1803, this should simply say &quot;Windows Server&quot;.  There are no other impacts anywhere else in the product, and there is no impact to the Windows Server 2019 product.  The issue is limited to this one image during setup of Windows Server, version 1809, available only to volume license customers accessing the Volume License Service Center.<br/> |
