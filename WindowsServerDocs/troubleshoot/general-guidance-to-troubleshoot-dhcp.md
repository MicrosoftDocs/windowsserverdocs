# General guidance to troubleshoot DHCP

Before you begin to troubleshoot, check the following items. These can
help you find the root cause of the problem.

## Checklist

  - When did the problem start?

  - Are there any error messages?

  - Was the DHCP server working previously, or has it never worked?
    If it worked previously, did anything change before the problem started. For example, was an update installed? Was a change made to the infrastructure?

  - Is the problem persistent or intermittent? If it is intermittent, when did it last occur?

  - Are address lease failures occurring for all clients or for only specific clients, such as a single-scope subnet?

  - Are there any clients on the same network subnet as the DHCP server?

  - If clients reside on the same network subnet, can they obtain IP addresses?

  - If clients are not on the same network subnet, are the routers or VLAN switches correctly configured to have DHCP relay agents (also known as IP Helpers)?

  - Is the DHCP server standalone or is it configured for high availability, such as split-scope or DHCP Failover?

  - Check the intermediate devices for features such as VRRP/HSRP, Dynamic ARP Inspection, or DHCP snooping that are known to cause problems.
