## Guidance on disabling system services on Windows Server 2016 with Desktop Experience

Applies to: Windows Server 2016

The Windows operating system includes many system services that provide important functionality. Different services have different default startup policies: some are started by default (automatic), some when needed (manual), and some are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled before they can run. These defaults were chosen carefully for each service to balance performance, functionality and security for typical customers.

However, some enterprise customers may prefer a more security-focused balance for their Windows PCs and servers, one that reduces their attack surface to the absolute minimum, and may therefore wish to fully disable all services that are not needed in their specific environments. For those customers, Microsoft® is providing the accompanying guidance regarding which services can safely be disabled for this purpose.

The guidance is for Windows Server 2016 with Desktop Experience (unless used as a desktop replacement for end users). Each service on the system is categorized as follows:

-   **Should Disable:** A security-focused enterprise will most likely prefer to disable this service and forego its functionality (see additional details below).
- **OK to Disable:** This service provides functionality that is useful to some but not all enterprises, and security-focused enterprises that don’t use it can safely disable it.
- **Do Not Disable:** Disabling this service will impact essential functionality or prevent specific roles/features from functioning correctly. It therefore should not be disabled.
-  **(No guidance):** These services should not be disabled.

Customers can configure their Windows PCs and servers to disable selected services using the Security Templates in their Group Policies or using PowerShell automation.  In some cases, the guidance includes specific Group Policy settings that disable the service’s functionality directly, as an alternative to disabling the service itself.

Microsoft recommends that customers disable the following services and their respective scheduled tasks on Windows Server 2016 with Desktop Experience:

Services: 
1.Xbox Live Auth Manager
2.Xbox Live Game Save

Scheduled tasks: 
1.\Microsoft\XblGameSave\XblGameSaveTask
2.\Microsoft\XblGameSave\XblGameSaveTaskLogon

<br />

### Disabling services not installed by default

Microsoft recommends against applying policies to disable services that are not installed by default.
-  The service is usually needed if the feature is installed. Installing the service or the feature requires administrative rights. Disallow the feature installation, not the service startup.
-  Blocking the Microsoft Windows service doesn't stop an admin (or non-admin in some cases) from installing a similar third-party equivalent, perhaps one with a higher security risk.
-  A baseline or benchmark that disables a non-default Windows service (for example, W3SVC) will give some auditors the mistaken impression that the technology (for example, IIS) is inherently insecure and should never be used.
-  If the feature (and service) is never installed, this just adds unnecessary bulk to the baseline and to verification work."

The following table and explanatory keys offer the Microsoft recommendations for enabling and disabling services in Windows Server 2016:
