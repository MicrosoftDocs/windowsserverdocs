# Audit Special Logon
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit Special Logon**, which determines whether the operating system generates audit events under special sign on \(or log on\) circumstances.

This security policy setting determines whether the operating system generates audit events when:

-   A special logon is used. A special logon is a logon that has administrator\-equivalent privileges and can be used to elevate a process to a higher level.

-   A member of a special group logs on. Special Groups is a Windows feature that enables the administrator to find out when a member of a certain group has logged on. The administrator can set a list of group security identifiers \(SIDs\) in the registry. If any of these SIDs is added to a token during logon and this auditing subcategory is enabled, a security event is logged. For more information about this feature, see [article 947223](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=120183) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base \(http:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkID\=120183\).

Users holding special privileges can potentially make changes to the system. We recommend that you track their activity.

Event volume: Low

Default: Success

If this policy setting is configured, the following events appear on computers running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the **Applies To** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.

|Event ID|Event message|
|------------|-----------------|
