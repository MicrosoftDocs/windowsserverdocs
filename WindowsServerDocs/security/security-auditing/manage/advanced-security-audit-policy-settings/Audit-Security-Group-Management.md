# Audit Security Group Management
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit Security Group Management**, which determines whether the operating system generates audit events when specific security group management tasks are performed.

Tasks for security group management include:

-   A security group is created, changed, or deleted.

-   A member is added to or removed from a security group.

-   A group's type is changed.

Security groups can be used for access control permissions and also as distribution lists.

Event volume: Low

Default: Success

If this policy setting is configured, the following events appear on computers running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the **Applies To** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.
