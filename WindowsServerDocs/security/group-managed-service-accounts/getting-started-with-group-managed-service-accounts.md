## <a name="BKMK_Prereqs"></a>Prerequisites
See the section in this topic on [Requirements for group Managed Service Accounts](#BKMK_gMSA_Req).

## <a name="BKMK_Intro"></a>Introduction
When a client computer connects to a service which is hosted on a server farm using network load balancing (NLB) or some other method where all the servers appear to be the same service to the client, then authentication protocols supporting mutual authentication such as Kerberos cannot be used unless all the instances of the services use the same principal. This means that each service has to use the same passwords/keys to prove their identity.

> [!NOTE]
> Failover clusters do not support gMSAs. However, services that run on top of the Cluster service can use a gMSA or a sMSA if they are a Windows service, an App pool, a scheduled task, or natively support gMSA or sMSA.

Services have the following principals from which to choose, and each has certain limitations.

|Principals|Scope|Services supported|Password management|
|-------|-----|-----------|------------|
|Computer Account of Windows system|Domain|Limited to one domain joined server|Computer manages|
|Computer Account without Windows system|Domain|Any domain joined server|None|
|Virtual Account|Local|Limited to one server|Computer manages|
|Windows 7 standalone Managed Service Account|Domain|Limited to one domain joined server|Computer manages|
|User Account|Domain|Any domain joined server|None|
|Group Managed Service Account|Domain|Any Windows Server 2012 domain-joined server|The domain controller manages, and the host retrieves|

A Windows computer account, or a Windows 7 standalone Managed Service Account (sMSA), or virtual accounts cannot be shared across multiple systems. If you configure one account for services on server farms to share, you would have to choose a user account or a computer account apart from a Windows system. Either way, these accounts do not have the capability of single-point-of-control password management. This creates problem where each organization needs to create an expensive solution to update keys for the service in Active Directory and then distribute the keys to all instances of those services.

With  Windows Server 2012 , services or service administrators do not need to manage password synchronization between service instances when using group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA). You provision the gMSA in AD and then configure the service which supports Managed Service Accounts. You can provision a gMSA using the *-ADServiceAccount cmdlets which are part of the Active Directory module. Service identity configuration on the host is supported by:

-   Same APIs as sMSA, so products which support sMSA will support gMSA

-   Services which use Service Control Manager to configure logon identity

-   Services which use the IIS manager for application pools to configure identity

-   Tasks using Task Scheduler.

### <a name="BKMK_gMSA_Req"></a>Requirements for group Managed Service Accounts
The following table lists the operating system requirements for Kerberos authentication to work with services using gMSA. The Active Directory requirements are listed after the table.

A 64-bit architecture is required to run the Windows PowerShell commands used to administer group Managed Service Accounts.

**Operating system requirements**

|Element|Requirement|Operating system|
|------|--------|----------|
|Client Application host|RFC compliant Kerberos client|At least Windows XP|
|User account's domain DCs|RFC compliant KDC|At least Windows Server 2003|
|Shared service member hosts|| Windows Server 2012 |
|Member host's domain DCs|RFC compliant KDC|At least Windows Server 2003|
|gMSA account's domain DCs| Windows Server 2012  DCs available for host to retrieve the password|Domain with Windows Server 2012 which can have some systems earlier than  Windows Server 2012 |
|Backend service host|RFC compliant Kerberos application server|At least Windows Server 2003|
|Backend service account's domain DCs|RFC compliant KDC|At least Windows Server 2003|
|Windows PowerShell for Active Directory|Windows PowerShell for Active Directory installed locally on a computer supporting a 64-bit architecture or on your remote management computer (for example, using the Remote Server Administration Toolkit)| Windows Server 2012 |

**Active Directory Domain Service requirements**

-   The Active Directory schema in the gMSA domain's forest needs to be updated to Windows Server 2012 to create a gMSA.

    You can update the schema by installing a domain controller that runs Windows Server 2012 or by running the version of adprep.exe from a computer running  Windows Server 2012 . The object-version attribute value for the object CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=Contoso,DC=Com must be 52.

-   New gMSA account provisioned

-   If you are managing the service host permission to use gMSA by group, then new or existing security group

-   If managing service access control by group, then new or existing security group

-   If the first master root key for Active Directory is not deployed in the domain or has not been created, then create it. The result of its creation can be verified in the KdsSvc Operational log, Event ID 4004.

For instructions how to create the key, see [Create the Key Distribution Services KDS Root Key](create-the-key-distribution-services-kds-root-key.md). Microsoft Key Distribution Service (kdssvc.dll) the root key for AD.

**Lifecycle**

The lifecycle of a server farm using the gMSA feature typically involves the following tasks:

-   Deploying a new server farm

-   Adding member hosts to an existing server farm

-   Decommissioning member hosts from an existing server farm

-   Decommissioning an existing server farm

-   Removing a compromised member host from a server farm if required.

## <a name="BKMK_DeployNewFarm"></a>Deploying a new server farm
When deploying a new server farm, the service administrator will need to determine:

-   If the service supports using gMSAs

-   If the service requires inbound or outbound authenticated connections

-   The computer account names for the member hosts for the service using the gMSA

-   The NetBIOS name for the service

-   The DNS host name for the service

-   The Service Principal Names (SPNs) for the service

-   The password change interval (default is 30 days).

### <a name="BKMK_Step1"></a>Step 1: Provisioning group Managed Service Accounts
You can create a gMSA only if the forest schema has been updated to  Windows Server 2012 , the master root key for Active Directory has been deployed, and there is at least one Windows Server 2012 DC in the domain in which the gMSA will be created.

Membership in **Domain Admins** or the  ability to create msDS-GroupManagedServiceAccount objects, is the minimum required to complete the following procedures.

> [!NOTE]
> A value for the -Name parameter is always required (whether you specify -Name or not), with -DNSHostName, -RestrictToSingleComputer, and -RestrictToOutboundAuthentication being secondary requirements for the three deployment scenarios.


#### <a name="BKMK_CreateGMSA"></a>To create a gMSA using the New-ADServiceAccount cmdlet

1.  On the Windows Server 2012 domain controller, run Windows PowerShell from the Taskbar.

2.  At the command prompt for the Windows PowerShell, type the following commands, and then press ENTER. (The Active Directory module will load automatically.)

    **New-ADServiceAccount [-Name] &lt;string&gt; -DNSHostName &lt;string&gt; [-KerberosEncryptionType &lt;ADKerberosEncryptionType&gt;] [-ManagedPasswordIntervalInDays <Nullable[Int32]>] [-PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword <ADPrincipal[]>] [-SamAccountName &lt;string&gt;] [-ServicePrincipalNames <string[]>]**

    |Parameter|String|Example|
    |-------|-----|------|
    |Name|Name of the account|ITFarm1|
    |DNSHostName|DNS host name of service|ITFarm1.contoso.com|
    |KerberosEncryptionType|Any encryption types supported by the host servers|None, RC4, AES128, AES256|
    |ManagedPasswordIntervalInDays|Password change interval in days (default is 30 days if not provided)|90|
    |PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword|The computer accounts of the member hosts or the security group that the member hosts are a member of|ITFarmHosts|
    |SamAccountName|NetBIOS name for the service if not same as Name|ITFarm1|
    |ServicePrincipalNames|Service Principal Names (SPNs) for the service|http/ITFarm1.contoso.com/contoso.com, http/ITFarm1.contoso.com/contoso, http/ITFarm1/contoso.com, http/ITFarm1/contoso, MSSQLSvc/ITFarm1.contoso.com:1433, MSSQLSvc/ITFarm1.contoso.com:INST01|

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The password change interval can only be set during creation. If you need to change the interval, you must create a new gMSA and set it at creation time.

    **Example**

    Enter the command on a single line, even though they might appear word-wrapped across several lines here because of formatting constraints.

    ```Powershell
    New-ADServiceAccount ITFarm1 -DNSHostName ITFarm1.contoso.com -PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword ITFarmHosts$ -KerberosEncryptionType RC4, AES128, AES256 -ServicePrincipalNames http/ITFarm1.contoso.com/contoso.com, http/ITFarm1.contoso.com/contoso, http/ITFarm1/contoso.com, http/ITFarm1/contoso
    ```

Membership in **Domain Admins**, **Account Operators**, or ability to create msDS-GroupManagedServiceAccount objects, is the minimum required to complete this procedure. For detailed information about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships, see [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).

##### To create a gMSA for outbound authentication only using the New-ADServiceAccount cmdlet

1.  On the Windows Server 2012 domain controller, run Windows PowerShell from the Taskbar.

2.  At the command prompt for the Windows PowerShell Active Directory module, type the following commands, and then press ENTER:

    **New-ADServiceAccount [-Name] &lt;string&gt; -RestrictToOutboundAuthenticationOnly [-ManagedPasswordIntervalInDays <Nullable[Int32]>] [-PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword <ADPrincipal[]>]**

    |Parameter|String|Example|
    |-------|-----|------|
    |Name|Name the account|ITFarm1|
    |ManagedPasswordIntervalInDays|Password change interval in days (default is 30 days if not provided)|75|
    |PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword|The computer accounts of the member hosts or the security group that the member hosts are a member of|ITFarmHosts|

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The password change interval can only be set during creation. If you need to change the interval, you must create a new gMSA and set it at creation time.

  **Example**

```PowerShell
New-ADServiceAccount ITFarm1 -RestrictToOutboundAuthenticationOnly - PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword ITFarmHosts$
```

Other services could support gMSA. See the appropriate product documentation for details on how to configure those services.

## <a name="BKMK_AddMemberHosts"></a>Adding member hosts to an existing server farm
If using security groups for managing member hosts, add the computer account for the new member host to the security group (that the gMSA's member hosts are a member of) using one of the following methods.

Membership in **Domain Admins**, or the ability to add members to the security group object, is the minimum required to complete these procedures.

-   Method 1: Active Directory Users and Computers

    For procedures how to use this method, see [Add a computer account to a group](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc733097(v=ws.11)) using the Windows interface, and [Manage Different Domains in Active Directory Administrative Center](manage-different-domains-in-active-directory-administrative-center.md).

-   Method 2: dsmod

    For procedures how to use this method, see [Add a computer account to a group](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc733097(v=ws.11)) using the command line.

-   Method 3: Windows PowerShell Active Directory cmdlet Add-ADPrincipalGroupMembership

    For procedures how to use this method, see [Add-ADPrincipalGroupMembership](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/ee617203(v=technet.10)).

If using computer accounts, find the existing accounts and then add the new computer account.

Membership in **Domain Admins**, **Account Operators**, or ability to manage msDS-GroupManagedServiceAccount objects, is the minimum required to complete this procedure. For detailed information about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships, see Local and Domain Default Groups.

#### To add member hosts using the Set-ADServiceAccount cmdlet

1.  On the Windows Server 2012 domain controller, run Windows PowerShell from the Taskbar.

2.  At the command prompt for the Windows PowerShell Active Directory module, type the following commands, and then press ENTER:

    **Get-ADServiceAccount [-Identity] &lt;string&gt; -Properties PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword**

3.  At the command prompt for the Windows PowerShell Active Directory module, type the following commands, and then press ENTER:

    **Set-ADServiceAccount [-Identity] &lt;string&gt; -PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword <ADPrincipal[]>**

|Parameter|String|Example|
|-------|-----|------|
|Name|Name the account|ITFarm1|
|PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword|The computer accounts of the member hosts or the security group that the member hosts are a member of|Host1, Host2, Host3|

**Example**

For example, to add member hosts type the following commands, and then press ENTER.

```PowerShell
Get-ADServiceAccount [-Identity] ITFarm1 -Properties PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword
```

```PowerShell
Set-ADServiceAccount [-Identity] ITFarm1 -PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword Host1$,Host2$,Host3$
```

## <a name="BKMK_Update_gMSA"></a>Updating the group Managed Service Account properties
Membership in **Domain Admins**, **Account Operators**, or the ability to write to msDS-GroupManagedServiceAccount objects, is the minimum required to complete these procedures.

Open the Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell, and set any property by using the Set-ADServiceAccount cmdlet.

For detailed information how to set these properties, see [Set-ADServiceAccount](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/ee617252(v=technet.10)) in the TechNet Library or by typing **Get-Help Set-ADServiceAccount** at the Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell command prompt and pressing ENTER.

## <a name="BKMK_DecommMemberHosts"></a>Decommissioning member hosts from an existing server farm
Membership in **Domain Admins**, or ability to remove members from the security group object, is the minimum required to complete these procedures.

### Step 1: Remove member host from gMSA
If using security groups for managing member hosts, remove the computer account for the decommissioned member host from the security group that the gMSA's member hosts are a member of using either of the following methods.

-   Method 1: Active Directory Users and Computers

    For procedures how to use this method, see [Delete a Computer Account](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc754624(v=ws.11)) using the Windows interface, and [Manage Different Domains in Active Directory Administrative Center](manage-different-domains-in-active-directory-administrative-center.md).

-   Method 2: drsm

    For procedures how to use this method, see [Delete a Computer Account](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc754624(v=ws.11)) using the command line.

-   Method 3: Windows PowerShell Active Directory cmdlet Remove-ADPrincipalGroupMembership

    For detailed information how to do this, see  [Remove-ADPrincipalGroupMembership](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/ee617243(v=technet.10)) in the TechNet Library or by typing **Get-Help Remove-ADPrincipalGroupMembership** at the Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell command prompt and pressing ENTER.

If listing computer accounts, retrieve the existing accounts and then add all but the removed computer account.

Membership in **Domain Admins**, **Account Operators**, or ability to manage msDS-GroupManagedServiceAccount objects, is the minimum required to complete this procedure. For detailed information about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships, see Local and Domain Default Groups.

##### To remove member hosts using the Set-ADServiceAccount cmdlet

Get-ADServiceAccount [-Identity] ITFarm1 -Properties PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword
```

```PowerShell
Set-ADServiceAccount [-Identity] ITFarm1 -PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword Host1$,Host3$
```

### <a name="BKMK_RemoveGMSA"></a>Step 2: Removing a group Managed Service Account from the system
Remove the cached gMSA credentials from the member host using Uninstall-ADServiceAccount or the NetRemoveServiceAccount API on the host system.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, is the minimum required to complete these procedures.

##### To remove a gMSA using the Uninstall-ADServiceAccount cmdlet

1.  On the Windows Server 2012 domain controller, run Windows PowerShell from the Taskbar.

2.  At the command prompt for the Windows PowerShell Active Directory module, type the following commands, and then press ENTER:

    **Uninstall-ADServiceAccount &lt;ADServiceAccount&gt;**

    **Example**

    For example, to remove the cached credentials for a gMSA named ITFarm1 type the following command, and then press ENTER:

    ```PowerShell
    Uninstall-ADServiceAccount ITFarm1
    ```
