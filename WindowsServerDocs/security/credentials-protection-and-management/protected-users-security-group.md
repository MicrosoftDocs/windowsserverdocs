# Protected Users Security Group

>Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

Protected Users is a global security group for Active Directory (AD) designed to protect against credential theft attacks. The group triggers non-configurable protection on devices and host computers to prevent credentials from being cached when group members sign-in.

## Prerequisites

Your system must meet the following prerequisites before you can deploy a Protected Users group:

- Hosts must be running one of the following operating systems:
  
  - Windows 8.1 or later
  - Windows Server 2012 R2 or later with the most recent security updates installed

- The domain functional level must be Windows Server 2012 R2 or later. For more information about functional levels, see [Forest and domain functional levels](../../identity/ad-ds/active-directory-functional-levels.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The built-in domain Administrator, `S-1-5-<domain>-500`, is always exempt from Authentication Policies, even when they're assigned to an Authentication Policy Silo. For more information, see [How to Configure Protected Accounts](../../identity/ad-ds/manage/how-to-configure-protected-accounts.md).

- Protected Users global security group memberships restrict members to only use Advanced Encryption Standards (AES) for Kerberos. Members of the Protected Users group must be able to authenticate using AES.

## Protections applied by Active Directory

Becoming a member of the Protected Users group means AD automatically applies certain pre-configured controls that the users won't be able to change unless they stop being group members.

### Device protections for signed in Protected Users

When the signed in user is a member of the Protected Users group, the group provides the following protections:

- Credential delegation (CredSSP) doesn't cache the user's plain text credentials even when the user enables the **Allow delegating default credentials** Group Policy setting.

- For Windows 8.1 and later and Windows Server 2012 R2 and later, Windows Digest doesn't cache the user's plaintext credentials even when they've enabled Windows Digest.

- NTLM stops caching the user's plaintext credentials or NT one-way function (NTOWF).

- Kerberos stops creating Data Encryption Standard (DES) or RC4 keys. Kerberos also doesn't cache the user's plaintext credentials or long-term keys after acquiring the initial Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).

- The system doesn't create a cached verifier at user sign-in or unlock, so member systems no longer support offline sign-in.

After you add a new user account to the Protected Users group, these protections will activate when the new Protected User signs in to their device.

### Domain controller protections for Protected Users

Protected User accounts that authenticate to a domain running Windows Server 2012 R2 or later are unable to do the following:

- Authenticate with NTLM authentication.

- Use DES or RC4 encryption types in Kerberos pre-authentication.

- Delegate with unconstrained or constrained delegation.

- Renew Kerberos TGTs beyond their initial four-hour lifetime.

The Protected Users group applies non-configurable settings to TGT expiration for every member account. Normally, the domain controller sets the TGT lifetime and renewal based on the following two domain policies:

- Maximum lifetime for user ticket
- Maximum lifetime for user ticket renewal

For Protected Users members, the group automatically sets these lifetime limits to 600 minutes. The user can't change this limit unless they leave the group.

## How the Protected Users group works

You can add users to the Protected Users group using the following methods:

- UI tools, such as [Active Directory Administrative Center (ADAC)](../../identity/ad-ds\get-started/adac/Introduction-to-Active-Directory-Administrative-Center-Enhancements--Level-100-.md) or [Active Directory Users and Computers](/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/remote-server-administration-tools).
- A command-line tool, such as [PowerShell](/powershell/module/activedirectory/add-adgroupmember).
- With PowerShell, using the [Add-ADGroupMember](/powershell/module/activedirectory/add-adgroupmember) cmdlet.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Never add accounts for services and computers to the Protected Users group. For those accounts, membership doesn't provide local protections because the password and certificate is always available on the host.
>
> - Don't add accounts that are already members of highly privileged groups, such as the Enterprise Admins or Domain Admins groups, until you can guarantee adding them won't have negative consequences. Highly privileged users in the Protected Users are subject to the same [limitations and restrictions](#protections-applied-by-active-directory) as regular users, and it's not possible to work around or change those settings. If you add all members of those groups to the Protected Users group, it's possible to accidentally lock out their accounts. It's important to test your system to make sure the mandatory setting changes won't interfere with account access for these privileged user groups.

Members of the Protected Users group can only authenticate using Kerberos with Advanced Encryption Standards (AES). This method requires AES keys for the account in Active Directory. The built-in Administrator doesn't have an AES key unless the password for the domain running Windows Server 2008 or later changes. Any account who has their password changed by a domain controller running an earlier version of Windows Server is locked out of authentication.

To avoid lockouts and missing AES keys, we recommend you follow these guidelines:

- Don't run tests in domains unless all domain controllers run Windows Server 2008 or later.

- If you have migrated accounts from other domains, you need to reset the password so the accounts have AES hashes. Otherwise, these accounts become able to authenticate.

- Users need to change passwords after switching to domain functional level of Windows Server 2008 or later. This ensures they have AES password hashes once they become members of the Protected Users group.

### Adding a Protected User global security group to down-level domains

Domain controllers that run an operating system earlier than Windows Server 2012 R2 can support adding members to the new Protected User security group. This way, these members can benefit from device protections before you upgrade the domain.

> [!NOTE]
> Domain controllers running earlier versions of Windows Server 2012 R2 don't support domain protections.

To create a Protected Users group on a domain controller running an earlier version of Windows Server:

1. [Transfer the PDC emulator role](/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/view-transfer-fsmo-roles#transfer-the-rid-master-pdc-emulator-and-infrastructure-master-roles) to a domain controller that runs Windows Server 2012 R2.

1. Replicate the group object to the other domain controllers.

After that, users can benefit from device protections before you upgrade the domain.

### Protected Users group AD properties

The following table specifies the Active Directory properties of the Protected Users group.

|Attribute|Value|

## Event logs

Two operational administrative logs are available to help troubleshoot events that are related to Protected Users. These new logs are located in Event Viewer and are disabled by default, and are located under **Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\Authentication**.

To enable capturing these logs:

1. Right-click on **Start**, then select **Event Viewer**.

1. Open **Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\Authentication**.

1. For each log you want to enable, right-click the log name, then select **Enable Log**.

|Event ID and Log|Description|
|----------|--------|
|104<p>**ProtectedUser-Client**|Reason: The security package on the client does not contain the credentials.<br>The error is logged in the client computer when the account is a member of the Protected Users security group. This event indicates that the security package does not cache the credentials that are needed to authenticate to the server.<p>Displays the package name, user name, domain name, and server name.|
|304<p>**ProtectedUser-Client**|Reason: The security package does not store the Protected User's credentials.<br>An informational event is logged in the client to indicate that the security package does not cache the user's sign-in credentials. It is expected that Digest (WDigest), Credential Delegation (CredSSP), and NTLM fail to have sign-on credentials for Protected Users. Applications can still succeed if they prompt for credentials.<p>Displays the package name, user name, and domain name.|
|100<p>**ProtectedUserFailures-DomainController**|Reason: An NTLM sign-in failure occurs for an account that is in the Protected Users security group.<br>An error is logged in the domain controller to indicate that NTLM authentication failed because the account was a member of the Protected Users security group.<p>Displays the account name and device name.|
|104<p>**ProtectedUserFailures-DomainController**|Reason: DES or RC4 encryption types are used for Kerberos authentication and a sign-in failure occurs for a user in the Protected User security group.<br>Kerberos preauthentication failed because DES and RC4 encryption types cannot be used when the account is a member of the Protected Users security group.<p>(AES is acceptable.)|
|303<p>**ProtectedUserSuccesses-DomainController**|Reason: A Kerberos ticket-granting-ticket (TGT) was successfully issued for a member of the Protected User group.|
