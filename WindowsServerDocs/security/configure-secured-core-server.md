# Configure Secured-core server

Secured-core is a collection of capabilities that offers built-in hardware, firmware, driver and
operating system security features. This article shows you how to configure Secured-core server by
using Windows Admin Center, the Windows Server Desktop Experience, and Group Policy.

Secured-core server is designed to deliver a secure platform for critical data and applications. For
more information, see [What is Secured-core server?](../security/secured-core-server.md)

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure Secured-core server, you must have the following security components
installed and enabled in the BIOS:

- Secure Boot.
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0.
- System firmware must meet preboot DMA protection requirements and set appropriate flags in ACPI
  tables to opt into and enable Kernel DMA Protection. To learn more about Kernel DMA Protection,
  see
  [Kernel DMA Protection (Memory Access Protection) for OEMs](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-kernel-dma-protection).
- A processor with support enabled in the BIOS for:
  - Virtualization extensions.
  - Input/Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU).
  - Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM).
  - Transparent Secure Memory Encryption is also required for AMD based systems.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling each of the security features in the BIOS can vary based on your hardware vendor. Make
> sure to check your hardware manufacturer's Secured-core server enablement guide.

You can find hardware certified for Secured-core server from the 
[Windows Server Catalog](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/), and Azure Stack HCI servers in the
[Azure Stack HCI Catalog](https://hcicatalog.azurewebsites.net/#/catalog?FeatureSupported=securedCoreServer).

## Enable security features

To configure Secured-core server you need to enable specific Windows Server security features,
select the relevant method and follow the steps.

#### [GUI](#tab/gui)

Here's how to enable Secured-core server using the user interface.

1. From the Windows desktop, open the **Start** menu, select **Windows Administrative Tools**, open
   **Computer Management**.
1. In Computer management, select **Device Manager**, resolve any device error if necessary.
   1. For AMD based systems, confirm the DRTM Boot Driver device is present before continuing
1. From Windows desktop, open the **Start** menu, select **Windows Security**.
1. Select **Device security > Core isolation details**, then enable **Memory Integrity** and
   **Firmware Protection**. You might not be able to enable Memory Integrity until you've enabled Firmware Protection first and restarted your server.
1. Restart your server when prompted.

Once your server has restarted, your server is enabled for Secured-core server.

#### [Windows Admin Center](#tab/WAC)

Here's how to enable Secured-core server using Windows Admin Center.

1. Sign into your Windows Admin Center portal.
1. Select the server you want to connect to.
1. Select **Security** using the left-hand panel, then select the **Secured-core** tab.
1. Check the Security Features with a status of _Not configured_, then select **Enable**.
1. When notified, select **Schedule system reboot** to persist the changes.
1. Select either the **Restart immediately** or **Schedule restart** at a time suitable for your
   workload.

Once your server has restarted, your server is enabled for Secured-core server.

#### [Group Policy](#tab/group-policy)

Here's how to enable Secured-core server for domain members using Group Policy.

1. Open the **Group Policy Management Console**, create or edit a policy applied to your server.
1. In the console tree, select **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System >
    Device Guard**.
1. For the setting, right-click **Turn On Virtualization Based Security** and select **Edit**.
1. Select **Enabled**, from the drop down menus select the following:
   1. Select **Secure Boot and DMA Protection** for the Platform Security Level.
   1. Select either **Enabled without lock** or  **Enabled with UEFI lock** for Virtualization Based Protect of Code Integrity.
   1. Select **Enabled** for the Secure Launch Configuration.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > If you use **Enabled with UEFI lock** for Virtualization Based Protect of Code Integrity, it
   > cannot be disabled remotely. To disable the feature, you must set the Group Policy to **Disabled**
   > as well as remove the security functionality from each computer, with a physically present user,
   > in order to clear configuration persisted in UEFI.

1. Select **OK** to complete the configuration.
1. Restart your server to apply the Group Policy.

Once your server has restarted, your server is enabled for Secured-core server.

## Verify Secured-core server configuration

Now that you've configured Secured-core server, select the relevant method to verify your configuration.

#### [GUI](#tab/gui)

Here's how to verify your Secured-core server is configured using the user interface.

1. From the Windows desktop, open the **Start** menu, type `msinfo32.exe` to open System
   Information. From the System Summary page, confirm:
    1. **Secure Boot State** and **Kernel DMA Protection** is On.
    1. **Virtualization-based security** is Running.
    1. **Virtualization-based security Services** Running shows **Hypervisor enforced Code
       Integrity** and **Secure Launch**.

#### [Windows Admin Center](#tab/WAC)

Here's how to verify your Secured-core server is configured using Windows Admin Center.

1. Sign into your Windows Admin Center portal.
1. Select the server you want to connect to.
1. Select **Security** using the left-hand panel, then select the **Secured-core** tab.
1. Check the all Security Features have a status of _Configured_.

#### [Group Policy](#tab/group-policy)

To verify Group Policy has applied to your server, run the following command from an elevated command prompt.

```cli
gpresult /SCOPE COMPUTER /R /V
```

In the output, confirm the Device Guard settings are applied under the Administrative Templates section. The following example shows the output when the settings are applied.
