# Shielded VMs for tenants - Deploying a shielded VM by using Virtual Machine Manager

If you have access to System Center 2016 - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), you can deploy a shielded VM for which a shielded VM template has already been created.

To deploy a shielded VM in VMM, use the instructions in [Provision a new shielded VM](/system-center/vmm/guarded-deploy-vm#provision-a-new-shielded-vm).
