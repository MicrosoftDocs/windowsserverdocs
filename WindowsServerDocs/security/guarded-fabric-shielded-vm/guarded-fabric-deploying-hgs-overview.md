# Deploying the Host Guardian Service

>Applies to: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

One of the most important goals of providing a hosted environment is to guarantee the security of the virtual machines running in the environment. As a cloud service provider or enterprise private cloud administrator, you can use a guarded fabric to provide a more secure environment for VMs. A guarded fabric consists of one Host Guardian Service (HGS) - typically, a cluster of three nodes - plus one or more guarded hosts, and a set of shielded virtual machines (VMs).

## Deployment tasks for guarded fabrics and shielded VMs

The following table breaks down the tasks to deploy a guarded fabric and create shielded VMs according to different administrator roles. Note that when the HGS admin configures HGS with authorized Hyper-V hosts, a fabric admin will collect and provide identifying information about the hosts at the same time.
