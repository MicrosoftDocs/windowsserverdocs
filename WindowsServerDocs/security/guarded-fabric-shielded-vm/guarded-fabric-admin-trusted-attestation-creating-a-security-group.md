# Create a security group for guarded hosts and register the group with HGS

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AD mode is deprecated beginning with Windows Server 2019. For environments where TPM attestation is not possible, configure [host key attestation](guarded-fabric-initialize-hgs-key-mode.md). Host key attestation provides similar assurance to AD mode and is simpler to set up.

This topic describes the intermediate steps to prepare Hyper-V hosts to become guarded hosts using Admin-trusted attestation (AD mode). Before taking these steps, complete the steps in [Configuring the fabric DNS for hosts that will become guarded hosts](guarded-fabric-configuring-fabric-dns-ad.md).


## Create a security group and add hosts

1. Create a new **GLOBAL** security group in the fabric domain and add Hyper-V hosts that will run shielded VMs. Restart the hosts to update their group membership.

2. Use Get-ADGroup to obtain the security identifier (SID) of the security group and provide it to the HGS administrator.

    ```powershell
    Get-ADGroup "Guarded Hosts"
    ```

    ![Get-AdGroup command with output](../media/Guarded-Fabric-Shielded-VM/guarded-host-get-adgroup.png)

## Register the SID of the security group with HGS

1. On an HGS server, run the following command to register the security group with HGS.
   Re-run the command if necessary for additional groups.
   Provide a friendly name for the group.
   It does not need to match the Active Directory security group name.

   ```powershell
   Add-HgsAttestationHostGroup -Name "<GuardedHostGroup>" -Identifier "<SID>"
   ```

2. To verify the group was added, run [Get-HgsAttestationHostGroup](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt652172.aspx).
