# Configure HGS for HTTPS communications

>Applies to: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

By default, when you initialize the HGS server it will configure the IIS web sites for HTTP-only communications.
All sensitive material being transmitted to and from HGS are always encrypted using message-level encryption, however if you desire a higher level of security you can also enable HTTPS by configuring HGS with an SSL certificate.
