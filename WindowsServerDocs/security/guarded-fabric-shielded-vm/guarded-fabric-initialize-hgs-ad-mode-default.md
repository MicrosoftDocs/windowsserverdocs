# Initialize the HGS cluster using AD mode in a new dedicated forest (default)

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Admin-trusted attestation (AD mode) is deprecated beginning with Windows Server 2019. For environments where TPM attestation is not possible, configure [host key attestation](guarded-fabric-initialize-hgs-key-mode-default.md). Host key attestation provides similar assurance to AD mode and is simpler to set up. 

1.  [!INCLUDE [Initialize HGS](../../../includes/guarded-fabric-initialize-hgs-default-step-one.md)] 
2.  [!INCLUDE [Obtain certificates for HGS](../../../includes/guarded-fabric-initialize-hgs-default-step-two.md)]

3.  Run [Initialize-HgsServer](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt652185.aspx) in an elevated PowerShell window on the first HGS node. The syntax of this cmdlet supports many different inputs, but the 2 most common invocations are below:

    -   If you are using PFX files for your signing and encryption certificates, run the following commands:

        ```powershell
        $signingCertPass = Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt "Signing certificate password"
        $encryptionCertPass = Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt "Encryption certificate password"

        Initialize-HgsServer -HgsServiceName 'MyHgsDNN' -SigningCertificatePath '.\signCert.pfx' -SigningCertificatePassword $signingCertPass -EncryptionCertificatePath '.\encCert.pfx' -EncryptionCertificatePassword $encryptionCertPass -TrustActiveDirectory
        ```

    -   If you are using non-exportable certificates that are installed in the local certificate store, run the following command. If you do not know the thumbprints of your certificates, you can list available certificates by running `Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My`.

        ```powershell
        Initialize-HgsServer -HgsServiceName 'MyHgsDNN' -SigningCertificateThumbprint '1A2B3C4D5E6F...' -EncryptionCertificateThumbprint '0F9E8D7C6B5A...' --TrustActiveDirectory
        ```

4.  [!INCLUDE [Initialize HGS](../../../includes/guarded-fabric-initialize-hgs-default-step-four.md)]  

5.  [!INCLUDE [Initialize HGS](../../../includes/guarded-fabric-initialize-hgs-default-step-five.md)]
