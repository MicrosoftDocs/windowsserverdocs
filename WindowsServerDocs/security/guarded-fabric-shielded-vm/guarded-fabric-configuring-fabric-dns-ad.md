# Configure the fabric DNS for guarded hosts (AD)

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016


>[!IMPORTANT]
>AD mode is deprecated beginning with Windows Server 2019. For environments where TPM attestation is not possible, configure [host key attestation](guarded-fabric-initialize-hgs-key-mode.md). Host key attestation provides similar assurance to AD mode and is simpler to set up.

A fabric administrator needs to configure the fabric DNS takes to allow guarded hosts to resolve the HGS cluster.
The HGS cluster must already be [set up by the HGS administrator](/WindowsServerDocs/virtualization/guarded-fabric-shielded-vm/guarded-fabric-setting-up-the-host-guardian-service-hgs.md).
