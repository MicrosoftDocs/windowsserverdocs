# Prerequisites for guarded hosts

>Applies to: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

Review the host prerequisites for the mode of attestation you've chosen, then click the next step to add guarded hosts.

## TPM-trusted attestation

Guarded hosts using TPM mode must meet the following prerequisites:

-   **Hardware**: One host is required for initial deployment. To test Hyper-V live migration for shielded VMs, you must have at least two hosts.

    Hosts must have:

    - IOMMU and Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)
    - TPM 2.0
    - UEFI 2.3.1 or later
    - Configured to boot using UEFI (not BIOS or "legacy" mode)
    - Secure boot enabled

-   **Operating system**: Windows Server 2016 Datacenter edition or later

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Make sure you install the [latest cumulative update](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4000825/windows-10-and-windows-server-2016-update-history).

-   **Role and features**: Hyper-V role and the Host Guardian Hyper-V Support feature. The Host Guardian Hyper-V Support feature is only available on Datacenter editions of Windows Server.

> [!WARNING]
> The Host Guardian Hyper-V Support feature enables Virtualization-based protection of code integrity that may be incompatible with some devices.
> We strongly recommend testing this configuration in your lab before enabling this feature.
> Failure to do so may result in unexpected failures up to and including data loss or a blue screen error (also called a stop error).
> For more information, see [Compatible hardware with Windows Server Virtualization-based protection of Code Integrity](guarded-fabric-compatible-hardware-with-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity.md).

## Host key attestation

Guarded hosts using host key attestation must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Hardware**: Any server capable of running Hyper-V beginning with Windows Server 2019
- **Operating system**: Windows Server 2019 Datacenter edition
- **Role and features**: Hyper-V role and the Host Guardian Hyper-V Support feature

The host can be joined to either a domain or a workgroup.

For host key attestation, HGS must be running Windows Server 2019 and operating with v2 attestation. For more information see [HGS prerequisites](guarded-fabric-prepare-for-hgs.md#prerequisites).

## Admin-trusted attestation

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Admin-trusted attestation (AD mode) is deprecated beginning with Windows Server 2019. For environments where TPM attestation is not possible, configure [host key attestation](#host-key-attestation). Host key attestation provides similar assurance to AD mode and is simpler to set up.

Hyper-V hosts must meet the following prerequisites for AD mode:

-   **Hardware**: Any server capable of running Hyper-V beginning with Windows Server 2016. One host is required for initial deployment. To test Hyper-V live migration for shielded VMs, you need at least two hosts.

-   **Operating system**: Windows Server 2016 Datacenter edition

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Install the [latest cumulative update](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4000825/windows-10-and-windows-server-2016-update-history).

-   **Role and features**: Hyper-V role and the Host Guardian Hyper-V Support feature, which is only available in Windows Server 2016 Datacenter edition.

> [!WARNING]
> The Host Guardian Hyper-V Support feature enables Virtualization-based protection of code integrity that may be incompatible with some devices.
> We strongly recommend testing this configuration in your lab before enabling this feature.
