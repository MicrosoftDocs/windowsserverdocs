# Verify the HGS configuration

>Applies to: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016


Next, we need to validate that things are working as expected. To do so, run the following command in an elevated Windows PowerShell console:

```powershell
Get-HgsTrace -RunDiagnostics
```

Because the HGS configuration does not yet contain information about the hosts that will be in the guarded fabric, the diagnostics will indicate that no hosts will be able to attest successfully yet. Ignore this result, and review the other information provided by the diagnostics.

Run the diagnostics on each node in your HGS cluster.
