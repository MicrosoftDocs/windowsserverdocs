>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

If your hosting service provider supports it, you can use Windows Azure Pack to deploy a shielded VM.

Complete the following steps:

<!-- When we have a link to the topic about how tenants subscribe, add that link as an indented item just under step 1 below. -->

1. Subscribe to one or more plans offered in Windows Azure Pack.

2. Create a shielded VM by using Windows Azure Pack.

    [Use shielded virtual machines](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt720674.aspx), which is described in the following topics:

    - [Create shielding data](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt720672.aspx) (and upload the shielding data file, as described in the second procedure in the topic).
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > As part of creating shielding data, you will download your guardian key file, which will be an XML file in UTF-8 format. Do not change the file to UTF-16.

This means that the template disk is not verified against the list of trusted disks in your shielding data file, nor are the secrets in your shielding data file used to provision the VM. If a shielded template is available, it is preferable to deploy a shielded VM with a shielded template to provide end-to-end protection of your secrets.
