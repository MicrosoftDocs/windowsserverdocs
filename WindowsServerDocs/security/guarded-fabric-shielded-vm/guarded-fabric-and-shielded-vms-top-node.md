# Guarded fabric and shielded VMs

>Applies to: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

One of the most important goals of providing a hosted environment is to guarantee the security of the virtual machines running in the environment. As a cloud service provider or enterprise private cloud administrator, you can use a guarded fabric to provide a more secure environment for VMs. A guarded fabric consists of one Host Guardian Service (HGS) - typically, a cluster of three nodes - plus one or more guarded hosts, and a set of shielded virtual machines (VMs).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that you have installed the latest cumulative update before you deploy shielded virtual machines in production.
