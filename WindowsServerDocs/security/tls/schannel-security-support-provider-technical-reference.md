# Schannel Security Support Provider Technical Reference

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

This reference for IT professionals contains information about the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, and the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol as implemented by the Schannel Security Support Provider (SSP).

These protocols provide a means to secure data that is being sent between applications across an untrusted network by using certificate-based authentication and symmetric encryption keys.

## <a name="w2k3tr_schan_intro"></a>In this document
This reference explains what TLS, SSL, and DTLS are; how TLS and SSL use the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) and Schannel SSP to secure data transfer across an untrusted network; and which tools and settings are available for configuring TLS and SSL.
