# Pre-Upgrade

## Upgrade Path

Windows Server 2012 can be upgraded to Windows Server 2019 in two consecutive upgrade processes - first by upgrading to Windows Server 2016, and then upgrading Windows Server 2016 to Windows Server 2019.

## Support

In-place Upgrade is supported for Windows Server 2012 on physical hardware, and in Virtual Machines. Public and private cloud companies also support In-place Upgrade Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2016 – check with your cloud provider.

## Alternative

Migrate (re-deploy) applications and data on a clean install of Windows Server 2016.

## Limitations

Windows Servers configured to “Boot from VHD” cannot be upgraded using In-place Upgrade.

## Planning for In-place Upgrade

Before proceeding with In-place Upgrade, collect the following information:

- Is there a target or goal time frame for upgrading this server?
- Is this a production-critical server?
- Is there a maintenance window for upgrading this server?
- Is there enough time for a test upgrade on an identical or similar non-production server?
- Who uses this server? Internal users, external users, or both? Have they been informed of the upgrade or maintenance?
- Is there an inventory of what is running on the server? Check the following:
    - Windows Server **Roles and Features**
    - **Microsoft applications:** SQL Server, SharePoint Server, Exchange Server, etc.
    - **3rd-Party applications:** SAP, Oracle, DB2, etc.
    - Is the server joined to an **Active Directory domain**?
    - Are any of the server disks **BitLocker** protected?
    - Is the server part of a **Failover Cluster**? Note that Failover Clusters have separate migration options.
- How often is the server backed-up? Have backups ever been successfully restored (applied) to the server or applications?
- What backup software is used?
- If In-place Upgrade is not successful and the server needs to be rebuilt, are the Windows Server and application install media available? Although it is rare, In-place Upgrade can fail and there should be a plan in-place for this possibility, to minimize server downtime and maintain SLAs.
- Is the server fully patched? It is strongly recommended that the server is fully patched prior to In-place Upgrade.
- Run **systeminfo.exe** and save the output:

- Run **ipconfig /all** and save the output:

- Run **Get-WindowsFeature** and save the output:

- Run **RegEdit** and capture the value of the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsNT\\CurrentVersion** hive

    – this will show the exact version (**BuildLabEx**) and edition (**EditionID**) of Windows Server:

## Before proceeding with the In-place Upgrade

1. Backup the Operating System, Applications, and Virtual Machines.
2. Shutdown, Quick Migrate, or Live Migrate all Virtual Machines running on the server - Virtual Machines **cannot** be running on the server during In-place Upgrade.
