# Set up Windows LAPS in the LAPS properties dialog

Learn how to use the LAPS properties dialog in the Windows Server Active Directory Users and Computers management snap-in to configure Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS) for Windows Server Active Directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows LAPS currently is available only in [Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 25145 and later](/windows-insider/flight-hub/#active-development-builds-of-windows-11). Support for the Windows LAPS Azure Active Directory scenario is currently in private preview, and limited to a small number of customers who have a direct engagement with engineering. Once public preview is declared in 2023, all customers will be able to evaluate this AAD scenario.

## LAPS properties dialog in the management snap-in

The Windows Server Active Directory Users and Computers management snap-in includes a LAPS properties dialog that's available for computer objects:

You can use the properties dialog to complete the following actions:

- View the current password expiration time.
- Modify the password expiration time.
- Expire the password expiration time.
- View the current account name and password.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The LAPS properties dialog doesn't support viewing legacy Microsoft LAPS passwords or password expiration times.

### View the current password expiration time

When you first go to the properties dialog for a Windows Server Active Directory computer, the date-time control displays the current password expiration time. For example:

:::image type="content" source="./media/laps-management-user-interface/laps-management-user-interface-view-password-expiration.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the current password expiration time in the Windows LAPS properties dialog in the Windows Server Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in.":::

### Modify the password expiration time

You can use the date-time control to modify the password expiration time. For example:

:::image type="content" source="./media/laps-management-user-interface/laps-management-user-interface-modify-password-expiration.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a modification of the password expiration time in the Windows LAPS properties dialog in the Windows Server Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in.":::

If you modify the date or time, select **Apply**, and then select **OK**.

### Manually expire the password

To immediately expire the password, select **Expire now**:

Select **Apply**, and then select **OK**.

### View the current account name and password

If you have permissions to read and decrypt the computer's current Windows LAPS password attribute, **Account Name** and **Password** have your username and password. Select **Copy password** to copy the password to the clipboard. Select **Show password** to show the password.

:::image type="content" source="./media/laps-management-user-interface/laps-management-user-interface-copy-show-password.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the copy and show password functionality in the Windows LAPS properties dialog in the Windows Server Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in.":::

If you don't have permissions to read or decrypt the current password information, a dialog displays a warning.
