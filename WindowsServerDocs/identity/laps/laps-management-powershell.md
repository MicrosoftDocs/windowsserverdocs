# Use Windows LAPS PowerShell cmdlets

Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (Windows LAPS) includes a specific PowerShell module named LAPS. Learn how to use the cmdlets in this module and what they do.

## Cmdlet descriptions

The following table describes the cmdlets that are available in the LAPS PowerShell module:

> [!TIP]
>
> - The `Invoke-LapsPolicyProcessing` and `Reset-LapsPassword` cmdlets aren't affected by whether the password currently is backed up to Microsoft Entra ID or Windows Server Active Directory. In this scenario, both options are supported.
>- All cmdlets in the Windows LAPS PowerShell module support detailed logging when you use the  `-Verbose` parameter.

## Windows LAPS PowerShell vs. legacy Microsoft LAPS PowerShell

Legacy Microsoft LAPS includes a PowerShell module named AdmPwd.PS. The two modules have many functional similarities, but they also have many differences. This table provides a mapping between the two modules:

|Windows LAPS cmdlet|Legacy Microsoft LAPS cmdlet|
|---|---|
|`Get-LapsAADPassword`|Doesn't apply|
|`Get-LapsDiagnostics`|Doesn't apply|
|`Find-LapsADExtendedRights`|`Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights`|
|`Get-LapsADPassword`|`Get-AdmPwdPassword`|
|`Invoke-LapsPolicyProcessing`|Doesn't apply|
|`Reset-LapsPassword`|Doesn't apply|
|`Set-LapsADAuditing`|`Set-AdmPwdAuditing`|
|`Set-LapsADComputerSelfPermission`|`Set-AdmPwdComputerSelfPermission`|
|`Set-LapsADPasswordExpirationTime`|`Reset-AdmPwdPassword`|
|`Set-LapsADReadPasswordPermission`|`Set-AdmPwdReadPasswordPermission`|
|`Set-LapsADResetPasswordPermission`|`Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission`|
|`Update-LapsADSchema`|`Update-AdmPwdADSchema`|

In addition to naming-related changes, the Windows LAPS PowerShell cmdlets for Windows Server Active Directory operate over an entirely different set of schema extensions. For more information, see [Windows LAPS schema extensions reference](laps-technical-reference.md#schema-extensions).
