# Deploying AD DS in a New Organization

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Thoroughly preparing your Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) design is essential to a cost-effective deployment. If your network environment is currently operating without a directory service, complete a comprehensive design of your AD DS logical structure before you deploy AD DS. Then, you can deploy a new forest root domain and deploy the rest of your domain structure according to your design.  
  
The following illustration shows the steps for deploying  Windows Server 2008  AD DS in a network environment that is currently operating without a directory service.
