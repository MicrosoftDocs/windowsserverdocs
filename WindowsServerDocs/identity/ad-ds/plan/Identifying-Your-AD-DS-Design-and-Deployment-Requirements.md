# Identifying Your AD DS Design and Deployment Requirements

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Performing a high-level assessment of your current environment and correctly identifying your Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) deployment tasks is essential for the success of your AD DS deployment strategy.  
  
Your AD DS deployment strategy depends on your existing network configuration. For example, if your organization currently runs Windows Server 2003, you can upgrade your operating system to Windows Server 2008. Your deployment process might involve restructuring existing domains, either within an Active Directory forest or between Active Directory forests. You may have to restructure your existing domains after you deploy Windows Server 2008 AD DS or after organizational changes or corporate acquisitions.
