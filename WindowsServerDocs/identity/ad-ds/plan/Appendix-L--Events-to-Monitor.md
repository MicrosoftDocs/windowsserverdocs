# Appendix L: Events to Monitor

>Applies To: Windows Server

The following table lists events that you should monitor in your environment, according to the recommendations provided in [Monitoring Active Directory for Signs of Compromise](../../ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/Monitoring-Active-Directory-for-Signs-of-Compromise.md). In the following table, the "Current Windows Event ID" column lists the event ID as it is implemented in versions of Windows and Windows Server that are currently in mainstream support.

The "Legacy Windows Event ID" column lists the corresponding event ID in legacy versions of Windows such as client computers running Windows XP or earlier and servers running Windows Server 2003 or earlier. The "Potential Criticality" column identifies whether the event should be considered of low, medium, or high criticality in detecting attacks, and the "Event Summary" column provides a brief description of the event.

A potential criticality of High means that one occurrence of the event should be investigated. Potential criticality of Medium or Low means that these events should only be investigated if they occur unexpectedly or in numbers that significantly exceed the expected baseline in a measured period of time. All organizations should test these recommendations in their environments before creating alerts that require mandatory investigative responses. Every environment is different, and some of the events ranked with a potential criticality of High may occur due to other harmless events.

|4960|N/A|Medium|IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.|
|4961|N/A|Medium|IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.|
|4962|N/A|Medium|IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.|
|4963|N/A|Medium|IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.|
|4965|N/A|Medium|IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.|
|4976|N/A|Medium|During Main Mode negotiation, IPsec received an invalid negotiation packet. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or an attempt to modify or replay this negotiation.|

|5480|N/A|Medium|IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer.
