# Finding Additional Resources for Logical Structure Design

> Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

You can find Additional Resources for Logical Structure Design in the following documentation about Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS):

- For more information about designing the site topology, see [Designing the Site Topology for Windows Server 2008 AD DS](Designing-the-Site-Topology.md).

- For worksheets to assist you in documenting the proposed forest, domain, Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, and organizational unit (OU) design, download Job_Aids_Designing_and_Deploying_Directory_and_Security_Services.zip from [Job Aids for Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit](https://microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=9608).
