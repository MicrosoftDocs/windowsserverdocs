# Finding Additional Resources for Logical Structure Design

>Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

You can find Additional Resources for Logical Structure Design in the following documentation about Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS):

- For more information about designing the site topology, see [Designing the Site Topology for Windows Server 2008 AD DS](Designing-the-Site-Topology.md).

- For worksheets to assist you in documenting the proposed forest, domain, Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, and organizational unit (OU) design, download Job_Aids_Designing_and_Deploying_Directory_and_Security_Services.zip from [Job Aids for Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit](https://microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=9608).
