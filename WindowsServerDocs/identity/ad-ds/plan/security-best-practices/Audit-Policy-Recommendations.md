# System audit policy recommendations

This article covers the Windows audit policy settings and Microsoft's baseline and advanced recommendations for both workstations and servers. It provides guidance to help administrators choose appropriate audit policies based on their organization's needs.

The Security Compliance Manager (SCM) baseline recommendations shown here, along with the recommended settings to help detect system compromise, are intended only to be a starting baseline guide to administrators. Each organization must make its own decisions regarding the threats they face, their acceptable risk tolerances, and what audit policy categories or subcategories they should enable. Administrators without a thoughtful audit policy in place are encouraged to start with the settings recommended here, and then to modify and test before implementing in their production environment.

The recommendations are for enterprise-class computers, which Microsoft defines as computers that have average security requirements and require a high level of operational functionality. Entities needing higher security requirements should consider more aggressive audit policies.

The following baseline audit policy settings are recommended for normal security computers that aren't known to be under active, successful attack by determined adversaries or malware.

## Recommended System Audit Policy by operating system

This section contains tables that list the audit setting recommendations that apply to the Windows operating system (OS) for both client and server.

**System Audit Policy table legend**

| **Notation** | **Recommendation** |
| --- | --- |
| Yes | Enable in general scenarios |
| No | Don't enable in general scenarios |
| If | Enable if needed for a specific scenario, or if a role or feature for which auditing is desired is installed on the machine |
| DC | Enable on domain controllers |
| [Blank] | No recommendation |

These tables contain the Windows default setting, the baseline recommendations, and stronger recommendations for which OS platform you're running.

## Set Audit Policy on workstations and servers

Effective event log management requires monitoring both workstations and servers. Focusing solely on servers or domain controllers (DC) is a common oversight, as initial signs of malicious activity often appear on workstations. By including workstations in your monitoring strategy, you gain access to critical early indicators of compromise.

Before you deploy any audit policy in a production environment, administrators should carefully review, test, and validate the policy to ensure it meets organizational security and operational requirements.

## Events to monitor

A perfect event ID to generate a security alert should contain the following attributes:

- High likelihood that occurrence indicates unauthorized activity

- Low number of false positives

- Occurrence should result in an investigative/forensics response

Two types of events should be monitored and alerted:

- Events where an occurrence is a strong indicator of unauthorized or suspicious activity.

- An accumulation of events above an expected and accepted baseline.

An example of the first event is:

If Domain Admins are forbidden from signing into the computers that aren't DCs, a single occurrence of a Domain Admin member logging on to an end-user workstation should generate an alert and be investigated. This type of alert is easy to generate by using the Audit Special Logon event 4964 (Special groups were assigned to a new logon). Other examples of single instance alerts include:

- If *Server A* should never connect to *Server B*, alert when they connect to each other.

- Alert if a standard user account is unexpectedly added to a privileged or sensitive security group.

- If employees in *factory location A* never work at night, alert when a user logs on at night.

- Alert if an unauthorized service is installed on a DC.

- Investigate if a regular end-user attempts to directly sign into a SQL Server for which they have no clear reason for doing so.

- If you have no members in your Domain Admin group, and someone adds themselves there, check it immediately.

An example of the second event is:

A high number of failed logon attempts might signal a password guessing attack. To detect this, organizations should first determine what is a normal rate of failed logons in their environment. Then alerts can be triggered when that baseline is exceeded.

For a comprehensive list of events that you should include when you monitor for signs of compromise, see [Appendix L: Events to Monitor](../../../ad-ds/plan/Appendix-L--Events-to-Monitor.md).

## Active Directory objects and attributes to monitor

The following are the accounts, groups, and attributes that you should monitor to help you detect attempts to compromise your Active Directory Domain Services installation.

- Systems for disabling or removal of antivirus and anti-malware software (automatically restart protection when it's manually disabled)

- Administrator accounts for unauthorized changes

- Activities that are performed by using privileged accounts (automatically remove account when suspicious activities are completed or the allotted time expired)

- Privileged and VIP accounts in AD DS. Monitor for changes to attributes on the Account tab, such as:

  - cn

  - name

  - sAMAccountName

  - userPrincipalName

  - userAccountControl

  In addition to monitoring the accounts, restrict who can modify the accounts to as small a set of administrative users as possible. Refer to [Appendix L: Events to Monitor](../../../ad-ds/plan/Appendix-L--Events-to-Monitor.md) for a list of recommended events to monitor, their criticality ratings, and an event message summary.

- Group servers by the classification of their workloads, which allows you to quickly identify the servers that should be the most closely monitored and most stringently configured

- Changes to the properties and membership of following AD DS groups:

  - Administrators

  - Domain Admins

  - Enterprise Admins

  - Schema Admins

- Disabled privileged accounts (such as built-in Administrator accounts in Active Directory and on member systems) for enabling the accounts

- Management accounts to log all writes to the account

- Built-in Security Configuration Wizard to configure service, registry, audit, and firewall settings to reduce the server's attack surface. Use this wizard if you implement jump servers as part of your administrative host strategy.

## Security event ID recommendation criticalities

All Event ID recommendations are accompanied by a criticality rating as follows:

| Rating | Description |
|--|--|
| **High** | Event IDs with a high criticality rating should always and immediately be alerted and investigated. |
| **Medium** | An Event ID with a medium criticality rating could indicate malicious activity, but it must be accompanied by some other abnormality. An example can include an unusual number occurring in a particular time period, unexpected occurrences, or occurrences on a computer that normally wouldn't be expected to log the event. A medium-criticality event might also be collected as a metric and then compared over time. |
| **Low** | And Event ID with a low criticality events shouldn't garner attention or cause alerts, unless correlated with medium or high criticality events. |

These recommendations are meant to provide a baseline guide for an administrator. All recommendations should be thoroughly reviewed before implementing in a production environment.
