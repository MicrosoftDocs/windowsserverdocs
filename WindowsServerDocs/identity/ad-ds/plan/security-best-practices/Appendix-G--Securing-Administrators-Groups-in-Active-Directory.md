# Appendix G: Securing Administrators Groups in Active Directory

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012


## Appendix G: Securing Administrators Groups in Active Directory
As is the case with the Enterprise Admins (EA) and Domain Admins (DA) groups, membership in the built-in Administrators (BA) group should be required only in build or disaster recovery scenarios. There should be no day-to-day user accounts in the Administrators group with the exception of the Built-in Administrator account for the domain, if it has been secured as described in [Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator Accounts in Active Directory](../../../ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/Appendix-D--Securing-Built-In-Administrator-Accounts-in-Active-Directory.md).

Administrators are, by default, the owners of most of the AD DS objects in their respective domains. Membership in this group may be required in build or disaster recovery scenarios in which ownership or the ability to take ownership of objects is required. Additionally, DAs and EAs inherit a number of their rights and permissions by virtue of their default membership in the Administrators group. Default group nesting for privileged groups in Active Directory should not be modified, and each domain's Administrators group should be secured as described in the step-by-step instructions that follow.

For the Administrators group in each domain in the forest:

1.  Remove all members from the Administrators group, with the possible exception of the built-in Administrator account for the domain, provided it has been secured as described in [Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator Accounts in Active Directory](../../../ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/Appendix-D--Securing-Built-In-Administrator-Accounts-in-Active-Directory.md).

2.  In GPOs linked to OUs containing member servers and workstations in each domain, the BA group should be added to the following user rights in **Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\ User Rights Assignment**:

    -   Deny access to this computer from the network

    -   Deny log on as a batch job

    -   Deny log on as a service

3.  At the domain controllers OU in each domain in the forest, the Administrators group should be granted the following user rights:

    -   Access this computer from the network

    -   Allow log on locally

    -   Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services

4.  Auditing should be configured to send alerts if any modifications are made to the properties or membership of the Administrators group.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions for Removing All Members from the Administrators Group

1.  In **Server Manager**, click **Tools**, and click **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

2.  To remove all members from the Administrators group, perform the following steps:

    1.  Double-click the **Administrators** group and click the **Members** tab.

        ![Screenshot that shows the Members tab for removing all members from the Administrators Group.](media/Appendix-G--Securing-Administrators-Groups-in-Active-Directory/SAD_79.gif)

    2.  Select a member of the group, click **Remove**, click **Yes**, and click **OK**.

3.  Repeat step 2 until all members of the Administrators group have been removed.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > If jump servers are used to administer domain controllers and Active Directory, ensure that jump servers are located in an OU to which this GPOs is not linked.

        > [!NOTE]
        > When you implement restrictions on the Administrators group in GPOs, Windows applies the settings to members of a computer's local Administrators group in addition to the domain's Administrators group. Therefore, you should use caution when implementing restrictions in the Administrators group. Although prohibiting network, batch, and service logons for members of the Administrators group is advised wherever it is feasible to implement, do not restrict local logons or logons through Remote Desktop Services. Blocking these logon types can block legitimate administration of a computer by members of the local Administrators group.
        >
        > The following screenshot shows configuration settings that block misuse of built-in local and domain Administrator accounts, in addition to misuse of built-in local or domain Administrators groups. Note that the **Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services** user right does not include the Administrators group, because including it in this setting would also block these logons for accounts that are members of the local computer's Administrators group. If services on computers are configured to run in the context of any of the privileged groups described in this section, implementing these settings can cause services and applications to fail. Therefore, as with all of the recommendations in this section, you should thoroughly test settings for applicability in your environment.

#### Verification Steps

##### Verify "Deny access to this computer from the network" GPO Settings
From any member server or workstation that is not affected by the GPO changes (such as a "jump server"), attempt to access a member server or workstation over the network that is affected by the GPO changes. To verify the GPO settings, attempt to map the system drive by using the **NET USE** command.

1.  Log on locally using an account that is a member of the Administrators group.

2.  With the mouse, move the pointer into the upper-right or lower-right corner of the screen. When the **Charms** bar appears, click **Search**.

3.  In the **Search** box, type **command prompt**, right-click **Command Prompt**, and then click **Run as administrator** to open an elevated command prompt.

4.  When prompted to approve the elevation, click **Yes**.

    ![Screenshot that highlights the User Account Control dialog box.](media/Appendix-G--Securing-Administrators-Groups-in-Active-Directory/SAD_97.gif)

5.  In the **Command Prompt** window, type **net use \\\\\<Server Name\>\c$**, where \<Server Name\> is the name of the member server or workstation you're attempting to access over the network.

6.  The following screenshot shows the error message that should appear.
