# Appendix F: Securing Domain Admins Groups in Active Directory

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012


## Appendix F: Securing Domain Admins Groups in Active Directory
As is the case with the Enterprise Admins (EA) group, membership in the Domain Admins (DA) group should be required only in build or disaster recovery scenarios. There should be no day-to-day user accounts in the DA group with the exception of the built-in Administrator account for the domain, if it has been secured as described in [Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator Accounts in Active Directory](../../../ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/Appendix-D--Securing-Built-In-Administrator-Accounts-in-Active-Directory.md).

Domain Admins are, by default, members of the local Administrators groups on all member servers and workstations in their respective domains. This default nesting should not be modified for supportability and disaster recovery purposes. If Domain Admins have been removed from the local Administrators groups on the member servers, the group should be added to the Administrators group on each member server and workstation in the domain. Each domain's Domain Admins group should be secured as described in the step-by-step instructions that follow.

For the Domain Admins group in each domain in the forest:

1.  Remove all members from the group, with the possible exception of the built-in Administrator account for the domain, provided it has been secured as described in [Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator Accounts in Active Directory](../../../ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/Appendix-D--Securing-Built-In-Administrator-Accounts-in-Active-Directory.md).

2.  In GPOs linked to OUs containing member servers and workstations in each domain, the DA group should be added to the following user rights in **Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignments**:

    -   Deny access to this computer from the network

    -   Deny log on as a batch job

    -   Deny log on as a service

    -   Deny log on locally

    -   Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services user rights

3.  Auditing should be configured to send alerts if any modifications are made to the properties or membership of the Domain Admins group.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions for Removing all Members from the Domain Admins Group

1.  In **Server Manager**, click **Tools**, and click **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

2.  To remove all members from the DA group, perform the following steps:

    1.  Double-click the **Domain Admins** group and click the **Members** tab.

        ![Screenshot that shows the Members tab for removing all members from the Domain Admins Group.](media/Appendix-F--Securing-Domain-Admins-Groups-in-Active-Directory/SAD_62.gif)

    2.  Select a member of the group, click **Remove**, click **Yes**, and click **OK**.

3.  Repeat step 2 until all members of the DA group have been removed.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions to Secure Domain Admins in Active Directory

1.  In **Server Manager**, click **Tools**, and click **Group Policy Management**.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > If jump servers are used to administer domain controllers and Active Directory, ensure that jump servers are located in an OU to which this GPOs is not linked.

#### Verification Steps

##### Verify "Deny access to this computer from the network" GPO Settings
From any member server or workstation that is not affected by the GPO changes (such as a "jump server"), attempt to access a member server or workstation over the network that is affected by the GPO changes. To verify the GPO settings, attempt to map the system drive by using the **NET USE** command.

1.  Log on locally using an account that is a member of the Domain Admins group.

2.  With the mouse, move the pointer into the upper-right or lower-right corner of the screen. When the **Charms** bar appears, click **Search**.

3.  In the **Search** box, type **command prompt**, right-click **Command Prompt**, and then click **Run as administrator** to open an elevated command prompt.

4.  When prompted to approve the elevation, click **Yes**.

    ![Screenshot that shows where to approve the elevation while verifying the Deny access to this computer network GPO settings.](media/Appendix-F--Securing-Domain-Admins-Groups-in-Active-Directory/SAD_73.gif)

5.  In the **Command Prompt** window, type **net use \\\\\<Server Name\>\c$**, where \<Server Name\> is the name of the member server or workstation you're attempting to access over the network.

6.  The following screenshot shows the error message that should appear.
