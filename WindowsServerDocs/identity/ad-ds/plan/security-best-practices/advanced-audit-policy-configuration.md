# Advanced Audit Policy Configuration

The Advanced Audit Policy Configuration settings are found under **Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\System Audit Policies** in Group Policy. These settings enable organizations to monitor compliance with key business and security requirements by tracking specific activities, such as:

- Modifications made by group administrators to settings or data on servers containing sensitive information (for example, finance servers).

- Access to critical files by employees within designated groups.

- Application of the correct system access control list (SACL) to all files, folders, or registry keys on a computer or file share, providing a verifiable safeguard against unauthorized access.

You can access these audit policy settings through the Local Security Policy snap-in (`secpol.msc`) on the local computer or by using Group Policy.

These advanced audit policy settings provide granular control over which activities are monitored, allowing you to focus on events that are most relevant to your organization. You can exclude auditing for actions that aren't important or that generate unnecessary log volume. Additionally, because these policies can be managed through domain Group Policy Objects, you can easily modify, test, and deploy audit configurations to specific users and groups as needed.

The advanced Audit Policy configurations are as follows:

- **Account Logon**

  Configuring policy settings in this category can help you document attempts to authenticate account data on a domain controller or on a local Security Accounts Manager (SAM). Unlike **Logon** and **Logoff** policy settings and events, which track attempts to access a particular computer, settings and events in this category focus on the account database that is used. This category includes the following subcategories:

  <br>
  <details>
  <summary> Expand Audit Credential Validation policy </summary>

  The **Audit Credential Validation** policy determines whether the OS (OS) generates audit events on credentials that are submitted for a user account logon request. These events occur on the computer that is authoritative for the credentials as follows:

  - For domain accounts, the domain controller is authoritative.

  - For local accounts, the local computer is authoritative.

  Because domain accounts are used much more frequently than local accounts in enterprise environments, most of the Account Logon events in a domain environment occur on the domain controllers that are authoritative for the domain accounts. However, these events can occur on any computer, and they might occur with or on separate computers from Logon and Logoff events.

  | Event ID | Event message |
  |--|--|
  | 4774 | An account was mapped for logon. |
  | 4775 | An account couldn't be mapped for logon. |
  | 4776 | The domain controller attempted to validate the credentials for an account. |
  | 4777 | The domain controller failed to validate the credentials for an account. |

  - Event volume: **High** on domain controllers.

  - Default on Client editions: **No Auditing**.

  - Default on Server editions: **Success**.

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary> Expand Audit Kerberos Authentication Service policy </summary>

  The **Audit Kerberos Authentication Service** policy controls whether audit events are generated when a Kerberos authentication ticket-granting ticket (TGT) is requested. With this setting enabled, it helps administrators monitor Kerberos sign-in activity and detect potential security issues related to authentication requests.

  If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated after a Kerberos authentication TGT request. Success audits record successful attempts and failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.

  | Event ID | Event message |
  |--|--|--|
  |  4768  | A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested. |

  <summary> Expand Audit IPsec Extended Mode policy </summary>

  The **Audit IPsec Extended Mode** policy determines whether the OS generates audit events for the results of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol and Authenticated Internet Protocol (AuthIP) during Extended Mode negotiations.

  IKE is an Internet standard, defined in [RFC 2409](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2409), that defines a mechanism to establish IPsec security associations. A security association is a combination of a mutually agreeable policy and keys that define the security services and mechanisms that help protect communication between IPsec peers.

  AuthIP is an enhanced version of IKE that offers additional flexibility, including support for user-based authentication and authentication with multiple credentials. It also provides improved authentication method negotiation and supports asymmetric authentication. Like IKE, AuthIP supports main-mode and quick-mode negotiation. AuthIP also supports Extended Mode, a part of IPsec peer negotiation during which a second round of authentication can be performed. Extended Mode, which is optional, can be used for multiple authentications. For example, with extended mode you can perform separate computer-based and user-based authentications.

  | Event ID | Event message |
  |--|--|
  | 4978 | During Extended Mode negotiation, IPsec received an invalid negotiation packet. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or an attempt to modify or replay this negotiation. |

  <summary> Expand Audit IPsec Main Mode policy </summary>

  The **Audit IPsec Main Mode** policy determines whether the OS generates audit events for the results of the IKE protocol and AuthIP during Quick Mode negotiations. Like IKE, AuthIP supports Main Mode and Quick Mode negotiation.

  Main Mode IKE negotiation establishes a secure channel, known as the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) security association, between two computers. To establish the secure channel, Main Mode negotiation determines a set of cryptographic protection suites, exchanges keying material to establish the shared secret key, and authenticates computer identities.

  | Event ID | Event message |

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary> Expand Audit IPsec Quick Mode policy </summary>

  The **Audit IPsec Quick Mode** policy determines whether the OS generates audit events for the results of the IKE protocol and AuthIP during Quick Mode negotiations. Like IKE, AuthIP supports Main Mode and Quick Mode negotiation.

  Quick Mode (also known as Phase 2) IKE negotiation establishes a secure channel between two computers to protect data. Quick Mode creates IPsec security associations, which are agreements between computers about how to protect network traffic. These associations are negotiated by the IPsec service.

  During Quick Mode, keying material is refreshed or, if necessary, new keys are generated. A protection suite that protects specified IP traffic is also selected. A protection suite is a defined set of data integrity or data encryption settings. Quick Mode isn't considered a complete exchange because it's dependent on a Main Mode exchange.

  | Event ID | Event message |

  <summary> Expand Audit Logoff policy </summary>

  The **Audit Logoff** policy determines whether the OS generates audit events when logon sessions are terminated. These events occur on the computer that was accessed. When an interactive logon occurs, these events are generated on the computer that was logged on to.

  > [!NOTE]
  > There's no failure event in this subcategory because failed logoffs (such as when a system abruptly shuts down) don't generate an audit record.

  Logon events are essential to understanding user activity and detecting potential attacks. Logoff events aren't 100 percent reliable. For example, the computer can be turned off without a proper logoff and shutdown; in this case, a logoff event isn't generated.

  <summary> Expand Audit Logon policy </summary>

  The **Audit Logon** policy determines whether the OS generates audit events when a user attempts to sign into a computer.

  These events are related to the creation of sign in sessions and occur on the computer that was accessed. For an interactive logon, events are generated on the computer that was logged on to. For a network logon, such as accessing a share, events are generated on the computer that hosts the resource that was accessed. Logon events are essential to tracking user activity and detecting potential attacks. The following events are recorded:

  - Logon success and failure.
  - Logon attempts by using explicit credentials. This event is generated when a process attempts to sign into an account by explicitly specifying that account's credentials. This most commonly occurs in batch configurations such as scheduled tasks, or when using the `runas` command.

  <summary> Expand Audit Special Logon policy </summary>

  The **Audit Special Logon** policy determines whether the OS generates audit events under special sign on (or log on) circumstances. This security policy setting determines whether the OS generates audit events when:

  - A special logon is used. A special logon is a logon that has administrator-equivalent privileges and can be used to elevate a process to a higher level.

  - A member of a special group logs on. Special Groups is a Windows feature that enables the administrator to find out when a member of a certain group has logged on. The administrator can set a list of group security identifiers (SIDs) in the registry. If any of these SIDs is added to a token during logon and this auditing subcategory is enabled, a security event is logged.

  Users holding special privileges can potentially make changes to the system. We recommend that you track their activity.

- **Object Access**

  Object Access policy settings and audit events allow you to track attempts to access specific objects or types of objects on a network or computer. To audit attempts to access a file, directory, registry key, or any other object, you must enable the appropriate Object Access auditing subcategory for success and/or failure events. For example, the File System subcategory needs to be enabled to audit file operations, and the Registry subcategory needs to be enabled to audit registry accesses. This category includes the following subcategories:

  <summary> Expand Audit Application Generated policy </summary>

  The **Audit Application Generated** policy determines whether the OS generates audit events when applications attempt to use the Windows Auditing application programming interfaces (APIs).

  The following events can generate audit activity:

  - Creation, deletion, or initialization of an application client context

  - Application operations

  Applications that are designed to use the Windows Auditing APIs can use this subcategory to log auditing events that are related to those APIs. The level, volume, relevance, and importance of these audit events depend on the application that generates them. The OS logs the events as they're generated by the application.

  <summary> Expand Audit IPsec Driver policy </summary>

  The **Audit IPsec Driver** policy determines whether the OS generates audit events for the activities of the IPsec driver. The IPsec driver, using the IP Filter List from the active IPsec policy, watches for outbound IP packets that must be secured and inbound IP packets that must be verified and decrypted. This security policy setting reports on the following activities of the IPsec driver:

  - Startup and shutdown of IPsec services.

  - Packets dropped due to integrity-check failure.

  - Packets dropped due to replay-check failure.

  - Packets dropped due to being in plaintext.

  - Packets received with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This can indicate malfunctioning hardware or interoperability problems.

  - Failure to process IPsec filters.

  A high rate of packet drops by the IPsec filter driver may indicate attempts to gain access to the network by unauthorized systems. Failure to process IPsec filters poses a potential security risk because some network interfaces may not get the protection that is provided by the IPsec filter.

  | Event ID | Event message |
  |--|--|
  | 4960 | IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue, or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. |
  | 4961 | IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. |
  | 4962 | IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. |
  | 4963 | IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. |
  | 4965 | IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. |
  | 5478 | IPsec Services has started successfully. |
  | 5479 | IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. |
  | 5480 | IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem. |
  | 5483 | IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services couldn't be started. |
  | 5484 | IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. |

  <summary> Expand Audit Security System Extension policy </summary>

  The **Audit Security System Extension** policy determines whether the OS generates audit events related to security system extensions. Changes to security system extensions in the OS include the following activities:

  - A security extension code is loaded (such as an authentication, notification, or security package). A security extension code registers with the Local Security Authority and will be used and trusted to authenticate logon attempts, submit logon requests, and be notified of any account or password changes. Examples of this extension code are Security Support Providers, such as Kerberos and NTLM.

  - A service is installed. An audit log is generated when a service is registered with the Service Control Manager. The audit log contains information about the service name, binary, type, start type, and service account.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Attempts to install or load security system extensions or services are critical system events that could indicate a security breach.

  | Event ID | Event message |

  <summary> Expand Audit System Integrity policy </summary>

  The **Audit System Integrity** policy determines whether the OS audits events that violate the integrity of the security subsystem. Activities that violate the integrity of the security subsystem include:

  - Audited events are lost due to a failure of the auditing system.

  - A process uses an invalid local procedure call (LPC) port in an attempt to impersonate a client, reply to a client address space, read to a client address space, or write from a client address space.

  - An RPC integrity violation is detected.

  - A code integrity violation with an invalid hash value of an executable file is detected.

  - Cryptographic tasks are performed.

- **Global Object Access**

  Global Object Access Auditing policy settings allow administrators to define computer SACLs per object type for the file system or for the registry. The specified SACL is then automatically applied to every object of that type.

  Auditors are able to prove that every resource in the system is protected by an audit policy by viewing the contents of the Global Object Access Auditing policy settings. For example, if auditors see a policy setting called "Track all changes made by group administrators," they know that this policy is in effect.

  Resource SACLs are also useful for diagnostic scenarios. For example, setting the Global Object Access Auditing policy to log all the activity for a specific user and enabling the policy to track "Access denied" events for the file system or registry can help administrators quickly identify which object in a system is denying a user access.

  If you select the **Define this policy setting** check box on the policy’s property page, then select **Configure**, you can add a user or group to the global SACL. This enables you to define computer SACLs per object type for the file system. The specified SACL is then automatically applied to every file system object type.

  <br>
  <details>
  <summary> Expand File System (Global Object Access Auditing) policy </summary>

  The **File System (Global Object Access Auditing)** policy enables you to configure a global SACL on the file system for an entire computer.

  If both a file or folder SACL and a global SACL are configured on a computer, the effective SACL is derived by combining the file or folder SACL and the global SACL. This means that an audit event is generated if an activity matches either the file or folder SACL or the global SACL.

  - Event volume: *Varies* on the effective SACL and the level of user activity.

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary> Expand Registry (Global Object Access Auditing) policy </summary>

  The **Registry (Global Object Access Auditing)** policy enables you to configure a global SACL on the registry of a computer.

  If both a registry SACL and a global SACL are configured on a computer, the effective SACL is derived by combining the registry SACL and the global SACL. This means that an audit event is generated when an activity matches either the registry key SACL or the global SACL.

  - Event volume: *Varies* on the effective SACL and the level of user activity.
