# Appendix E: Securing Enterprise Admins Groups in Active Directory

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012


## Appendix E: Securing Enterprise Admins Groups in Active Directory
The Enterprise Admins (EA) group, which is housed in the forest root domain, should contain no users on a day-to-day basis, with the possible exception of the root domain's Administrator account, provided it is secured as described in [Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator Accounts in Active Directory](../../../ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/Appendix-D--Securing-Built-In-Administrator-Accounts-in-Active-Directory.md).

Enterprise Admins are, by default, members of the Administrators group in each domain in the forest. You should not remove the EA group from the Administrators groups in each domain because in the event of a forest disaster recovery scenario, EA rights will likely be required. The forest's Enterprise Admins group should be secured as detailed in the step-by-step instructions that follow.

For the Enterprise Admins group in the forest:

1.  In GPOs linked to OUs containing member servers and workstations in each domain, the Enterprise Admins group should be added to the following user rights in **Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignments**:

    -   Deny access to this computer from the network

    -   Deny log on as a batch job

    -   Deny log on as a service

    -   Deny log on locally

    -   Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services

2.  Configure auditing to send alerts if any modifications are made to the properties or membership of the Enterprise Admins group.

### Step-by-Step Instructions for Removing All Members from the Enterprise Admins Group

1.  In **Server Manager**, click **Tools**, and click **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

2.  If you are not managing the root domain for the forest, in the console tree, right-click <Domain>, and then click **Change Domain** (where <Domain> is the name of the domain you're currently administering).

    ![Screenshot that highlights the Change Domain menu option.](media/Appendix-E--Securing-Enterprise-Admins-Groups-in-Active-Directory/SAD_43.gif)

3.  In the **Change domain** dialog box, click **Browse**, select the root domain for the forest, and click **OK**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the OK button in the Change domain dialog box.](media/Appendix-E--Securing-Enterprise-Admins-Groups-in-Active-Directory/SAD_44.gif)

4.  To remove all members from the EA group:

    1.  Double-click the **Enterprise Admins** group and then click the **Members** tab.

        ![Screenshot that shows the Members tab within the Enterprise Admins group.](media/Appendix-E--Securing-Enterprise-Admins-Groups-in-Active-Directory/SAD_45.gif)

    2.  Select a member of the group, click **Remove**, click **Yes**, and click **OK**.

5.  Repeat step 2 until all members of the EA group have been removed.

### Step-by-Step Instructions to Secure Enterprise Admins in Active Directory

1.  In **Server Manager**, click **Tools**, and click **Group Policy Management**.

2.  In the console tree, expand <Forest>\Domains\\<Domain>, and then **Group Policy Objects** (where <Forest> is the name of the forest and <Domain> is the name of the domain where you want to set the Group Policy).

    > [!NOTE]
    > In a forest that contains multiple domains, a similar GPO should be created in each domain that requires that the Enterprise Admins group be secured.

3.  In the console tree, right-click **Group Policy Objects**, and click **New**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the New menu option in the Group Policy Objects menu.](media/Appendix-E--Securing-Enterprise-Admins-Groups-in-Active-Directory/SAD_46.gif)

### Verification Steps

#### Verify "Deny access to this computer from the network" GPO Settings
From any member server or workstation that is not affected by the GPO changes (such as a "jump server"), attempt to access a member server or workstation over the network that is affected by the GPO changes. To verify the GPO settings, attempt to map the system drive by using the **NET USE** command by performing the following steps:

1.  Log on locally using an account that is a member of the EA group.

2.  With the mouse, move the pointer into the upper-right or lower-right corner of the screen. When the **Charms** bar appears, click **Search**.

3.  In the **Search** box, type **command prompt**, right-click **Command Prompt**, and then click **Run as administrator** to open an elevated command prompt.

4.  When prompted to approve the elevation, click **Yes**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the dialog box where you approve the elevation.](media/Appendix-E--Securing-Enterprise-Admins-Groups-in-Active-Directory/SAD_56.gif)

5.  In the **Command Prompt** window, type **net use \\\\\<Server Name\>\c$**, where \<Server Name\> is the name of the member server or workstation you're attempting to access over the network.

6.  The following screenshot shows the error message that should appear.
