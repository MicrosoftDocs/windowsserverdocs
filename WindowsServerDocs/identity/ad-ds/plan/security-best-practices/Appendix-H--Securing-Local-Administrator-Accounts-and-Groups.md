# Appendix H: Securing Local Administrator Accounts and Groups

> Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012


## Appendix H: Securing Local Administrator Accounts and Groups

On all versions of Windows currently in mainstream support, the local Administrator account is disabled by default, which makes the account unusable for pass-the-hash and other credential theft attacks. However, in environments that contain legacy operating systems or in which local Administrator accounts have been enabled, these accounts can be used as previously described to propagate compromise across member servers and workstations. Each local Administrator account and group should be secured as described in the step-by-step instructions that follow.

For detailed information about considerations in securing Built-in Administrator (BA) groups, see [Implementing Least-Privilege Administrative Models](../../../ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/Implementing-Least-Privilege-Administrative-Models.md).

#### Controls for Local Administrator Accounts

For the local Administrator account in each domain in your forest, you should configure the following settings:

- Configure GPOs to restrict the domain's Administrator account's use on domain-joined systems
    - In one or more GPOs that you create and link to workstation and member server OUs in each domain, add the Administrator account to the following user rights in **Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignments**:

        - Deny access to this computer from the network

        - Deny log on as a batch job

        - Deny log on as a service

        - Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services

#### Step-by-Step Instructions to Secure Local Administrators Groups

###### Configuring GPOs to Restrict Administrator Account on Domain-Joined Systems

1. In **Server Manager**, click **Tools**, and click **Group Policy Management**.

2. In the console tree, expand \<Forest\>\Domains\\<Domain\>, and then **Group Policy Objects** (where \<Forest\> is the name of the forest and \<Domain\> is the name of the domain where you want to set the Group Policy).

3. In the console tree, right-click **Group Policy Objects**, and click **New**.

4. In the **New GPO** dialog box, type **\<GPO Name\>**, and click **OK** (where \<GPO Name\> is the name of this GPO).

    ![Screenshot that shows where to name the GPO so you can configure GPOs to restrict the administrator account on domain-joined systems.](media/Appendix-H--Securing-Local-Administrator-Accounts-and-Groups/SAD_102.png)

5. In the details pane, right-click **\<GPO Name\>**, and click **Edit**.

6. Navigate to **Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies**, and click **User Rights Assignment**.

    ![Screenshot that shows where to navigate so you can configure GPOs to restrict the administrator account on domain-joined systems.](media/Appendix-H--Securing-Local-Administrator-Accounts-and-Groups/SAD_103.png)

7. Configure the user rights to prevent the local Administrator account from accessing members servers and workstations over the network by doing the following:

    1. Double-click **Deny access to this computer from the network** and select **Define these policy settings**.

    2. Click **Add User or Group**, type the user name of the local Administrator account, and click **OK**. This user name will be **Administrator**, the default when Windows is installed.

    3. Click OK.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > When you add the Administrator account to these settings, you specify whether you are configuring a local Administrator account or a domain Administrator account by how you label the accounts. For example, to add the TAILSPINTOYS domain's Administrator account to these deny rights, you would browse to the Administrator account for the TAILSPINTOYS domain, which would appear as TAILSPINTOYS\Administrator. If you type **Administrator** in these user rights settings in the Group Policy Object Editor, you will restrict the local Administrator account on each computer to which the GPO is applied, as described earlier.

8. Configure the user rights to prevent the local Administrator account from logging on as a batch job by doing the following:

    1. Double-click **Deny log on as a batch job** and select **Define these policy settings**.

    2. Click **Add User or Group**, type the user name of the local Administrator account, and click **OK**. This user name will be **Administrator**, the default when Windows is installed.

    3. Click **OK**.

If you type **Administrator** in these user rights settings in the Group Policy Object Editor, you will restrict the local Administrator account on each computer to which the GPO is applied, as described earlier.

9. Configure the user rights to prevent the local Administrator account from logging on as a service by doing the following:

    1. Double-click **Deny log on as a service** and select **Define these policy settings**.

    2. Click **Add User or Group**, type the user name of the local Administrator account, and click **OK**. This user name will be **Administrator**, the default when Windows is installed.

10. Configure the user rights to prevent the local Administrator account from accessing member servers and workstations via Remote Desktop Services by doing the following:

    1. Double-click **Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services** and select **Define these policy settings**.

    2. Click **Add User or Group**, type the user name of the local Administrator account, and click **OK**. This user name will be **Administrator**, the default when Windows is installed.

11. To exit **Group Policy Management Editor**, click **File**, and click **Exit**.

12. In **Group Policy Management**, link the GPO to the member server and workstation OUs by doing the following:

    1. Navigate to the \<Forest\>\Domains\\<Domain\> (where \<Forest\> is the name of the forest and \<Domain\> is the name of the domain where you want to set the Group Policy).

    2. Right-click the OU that the GPO will be applied to and click **Link an existing GPO**.

        ![Screenshot that shows the Link an existing GPO menu option when you're attempting to link the GPO to the member server and workstation OUs.](media/Appendix-H--Securing-Local-Administrator-Accounts-and-Groups/SAD_108.png)

    3. Select the GPO that you created and click **OK**.

        ![Screenshot that shows where to select the GPO you just created while you're linking the GPO to the member server and workstation OUs.](media/Appendix-H--Securing-Local-Administrator-Accounts-and-Groups/SAD_109.png)

    4. Create links to all other OUs that contain workstations.

    5. Create links to all other OUs that contain member servers.

#### Verification Steps

##### Verify "Deny access to this computer from the network" GPO Settings

From any member server or workstation that is not affected by the GPO changes (such as a jump server), attempt to access a member server or workstation over the network that is affected by the GPO changes. To verify the GPO settings, attempt to map the system drive by using the **NET USE** command.

1. Log on locally to any member server or workstation that is not affected by the GPO changes.

2. With the mouse, move the pointer into the upper-right or lower-right corner of the screen. When the **Charms** bar appears, click **Search**.

3. In the **Search** box, type **command prompt**, right-click **Command Prompt**, and then click **Run as administrator** to open an elevated command prompt.

4. When prompted to approve the elevation, click **Yes**.

    ![Screenshot that highlights the User Account Control dialog box you'll see when verifying the GPO settings.](media/Appendix-H--Securing-Local-Administrator-Accounts-and-Groups/SAD_110.png)

5. In the **Command Prompt** window, type `net use \\<Server Name>\c$ /user:<Server Name>\Administrator`, where \<Server Name\> is the name of the member server or workstation you're attempting to access over the network.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The local Administrator credentials must be from the same system you're attempting to access over the network.

6. The following screenshot shows the error message that should appear.
