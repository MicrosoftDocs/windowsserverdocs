# Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator Accounts in Active Directory

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012


## Appendix D: Securing Built-In Administrator Accounts in Active Directory
In each domain in Active Directory, an Administrator account is created as part of the creation of the domain. This account is by default a member of the Domain Admins and Administrators groups in the domain, and if the domain is the forest root domain, the account is also a member of the Enterprise Admins group.

Use of a domain's Administrator account should be reserved only for initial build activities, and possibly, disaster-recovery scenarios. To ensure that an Administrator account can be used to effect repairs in the event that no other accounts can be used, you should not change the default membership of the Administrator account in any domain in the forest. Instead, you should secure the Administrator account in each domain in the forest as described in the following section and detailed in the step-by-step instructions that follow.

> [!NOTE]
> This guide used to recommend disabling the account. This was removed as the forest recovery white paper makes use of the default administrator account. The reason is, this is the only account that allows logon without a Global Catalog Server.


#### Controls for Built-in Administrator Accounts
For the built-in Administrator account in each domain in your forest, you should configure the following settings:

-   Enable the **Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated** flag on the account.

-   Enable the **Smart card is required for interactive logon** flag on the account.

-   Configure GPOs to restrict the Administrator account's use on domain-joined systems:

    -   In one or more GPOs that you create and link to workstation and member server OUs in each domain, add each domain's Administrator account to the following user rights in **Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignments**:

        -   Deny access to this computer from the network

        -   Deny log on as a batch job

        -   Deny log on as a service

        -   Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services

> [!NOTE]
> When you add accounts to this setting, you must specify whether you are configuring local Administrator accounts or domain Administrator accounts. For example, to add the NWTRADERS domain's Administrator account to these deny rights, you must type the account as NWTRADERS\Administrator, or browse to the Administrator account for the NWTRADERS domain. If you type "Administrator" in these user rights settings in the Group Policy Object Editor, you will restrict the local Administrator account on each computer to which the GPO is applied.
>
> We recommend restricting local Administrator accounts on member servers and workstations in the same manner as domain-based Administrator accounts. Therefore, you should generally add the Administrator account for each domain in the forest and the Administrator account for the local computers to these user rights settings. The following screenshot shows an example of configuring these user rights to block local Administrator accounts and a domain's Administrator account from performing logons that should not be needed for these accounts.

-   Configure GPOs to restrict Administrator accounts on domain controllers
    -   In each domain in the forest, the Default Domain Controllers GPO or a policy linked to the domain controllers OU should be modified to add each domain's Administrator account to the following user rights in **Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignments**:
        -   Deny access to this computer from the network

        -   Deny log on as a batch job

        -   Deny log on as a service

        -   Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services

> [!NOTE]
> These settings will ensure that the domain's built-in Administrator account cannot be used to connect to a domain controller, although the account, if enabled, can log on locally to domain controllers. Because this account should only be enabled and used in disaster-recovery scenarios, it is anticipated that physical access to at least one domain controller will be available, or that other accounts with permissions to access domain controllers remotely can be used.

-   Configure Auditing of Administrator Accounts

    When you have secured each domain's Administrator account and disabled it, you should configure auditing to monitor for changes to the account. If the account is enabled, its password is reset, or any other modifications are made to the account, alerts should be sent to the users or teams responsible for administration of Active Directory, in addition to incident response teams in your organization.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions to Secure Built-in Administrator Accounts in Active Directory

1.  In **Server Manager**, click **Tools**, and click **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

2.  To prevent attacks that leverage delegation to use the account's credentials on other systems, perform the following steps:

    1.  Right-click the **Administrator** account and click **Properties**.

    2.  Click the **Account** tab.

    3.  Under **Account options**, select **Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated** flag as indicated in the following screenshot, and click **OK**.

        ![Screenshot that shows the Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated check box.](media/Appendix-D--Securing-Built-In-Administrator-Accounts-in-Active-Directory/SAD_24.gif)

3.  To enable the **Smart card is required for interactive logon** flag on the account, perform the following steps:

    1.  Right-click the **Administrator** account and select **Properties**.

    2.  Click the **Account** tab.

    3.  Under **Account** options, select the **Smart card is required for interactive logon** flag as indicated in the following screenshot, and click **OK**.

    5.  Create links to all other OUs that contain member servers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you add the Administrator account to these settings, you specify whether you are configuring a local Administrator account or a domain Administrator account by how you label the accounts. For example, to add the TAILSPINTOYS domain's Administrator account to these deny rights, you would browse to the Administrator account for the TAILSPINTOYS domain, which would appear as TAILSPINTOYS\Administrator. If you type "Administrator" in these user rights settings in the Group Policy Object Editor, you will restrict the local Administrator account on each computer to which the GPO is applied, as described earlier.

#### Verification Steps
The verification steps outlined here are specific to Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.

##### Verify "Smart card is required for interactive logon" Account Option
