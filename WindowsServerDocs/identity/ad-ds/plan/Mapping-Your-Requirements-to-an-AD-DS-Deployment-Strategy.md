# Mapping Your Requirements to an AD DS Deployment Strategy

> Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

After you finish reviewing and identifying the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) design and deployment requirements and you determine which of them are related to your specific deployment, you can map those requirements to a specific AD DS deployment strategy.

Use the following table to determine which AD DS deployment strategy maps to the appropriate combination of AD DS design and deployment requirements for your organization. ("Yes" means that a specific requirement is necessary for your deployment strategy; "No" means that a specific requirement is not necessary for your deployment strategy.)

This table refers only to the three primary AD DS deployment strategies as described in this guide:

-   [Deploying AD DS in a New Organization](../../ad-ds/plan/Deploying-AD-DS-in-a-New-Organization.md)

-   [Deploying AD DS in a Windows Server 2003 Organization](../../ad-ds/plan/Deploying-AD-DS-in-a-Windows-Server-2003-Organization.md)

-   [Deploying AD DS in a Windows 2000 Organization](../../ad-ds/plan/Deploying-AD-DS-in-a-Windows-2000-Organization.md)

However, you can create a hybrid or custom AD DS deployment strategy by using any combination of the AD DS design and deployment requirements to meet the needs of your organization.
