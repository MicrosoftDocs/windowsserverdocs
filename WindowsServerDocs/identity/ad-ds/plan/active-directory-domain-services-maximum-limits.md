# Active Directory Domain Services maximum limits and scalability

This article describes the maximum limits for certain aspects of your Active Directory environment that can affect scalability. We recommend you keep these limits in mind when you plan for your Active Directory deployment.

## Maximum number of objects

Each domain controller in an Active Directory forest can create almost 2.15 billion objects during its lifetime.

Each Active Directory domain controller has a unique identifier that's specific to the individual domain controller. These identifiers, which are called Distinguished Name Tags (DNTs), are unique values that aren't replicated or otherwise visible to other domain controllers. The range of values for DNTs is from 0 through 2,147,483,393 (231 minus 255). When you delete an object, no new objects you create afterwards can use the same DNT. Therefore, domain controllers are limited to creating fewer than two billion objects, which also includes objects that the domain controller replicates. This limit applies to the aggregate of all objects from all partitions hosted on the domain controller, including the domain network computer (NC), configuration, schema, and any application directory partitions.

There are ways to work around the domain controller lifetime creation limit. For example, you can remove objects from the domain by deleting them permanently. You can also install a new domain controller that replicates the remaining objects from the potential domain controller. However, you must make sure the new domain controller receives the objects through replication, and that you don't promote it by using the Install from Media (IFM) option. Domain controllers installed via IFM inherit the DNT values from the domain controller that the IFM backup was based on.

When you reach the DNT limit on a database, you see the following error message:

```cmd
Error: Add: Operations Error. <1> Server error: 000020EF: SvcErr: DSID-0208044C, problem 5012 (DIR_ERROR), data -1076.
```

You can run the following command to check the *approximateHighestInternalObjectID* attribute to see the highest DNT that your domain controller currently uses:

```cmd
$ossupported = $false
 
# max possible DNTs
$maxdnts = [System.Math]::Pow(2, 31) - 255
 
# connect rootDSE
$root = [ADSI]"LDAP://rootDSE"
 
# get operational attribute dsaVersionString
$root.RefreshCache("dsaVersionString")
 
# get version string usable in System.Version
$osverstring = $root.dsaVersionString[0].Substring(0, $root.dsaVersionString[0].IndexOf(" "))
 
try
{
    $osver = New-Object System.Version $osverstring
 
    # we need at least W2K12 DC to see the approximateHighestInternalObjectID exposed
    if ($osver.Major -gt 6)
    { $ossupported = $true }
 
    elseif ($osver.Major -eq 6)
    { $ossupported = ($osver.Minor -ge 2) }
}
 
catch
{ Write-Host "ERROR: Could not evaluate DC OsVer!"  }
 
if ($ossupported)
{
    # get operational attribute approximateHighestInternalObjectID
    $root.RefreshCache("approximateHighestInternalObjectID")
 
    Write-Host "Approx highest committed DNT: $($root.approximateHighestInternalObjectID[0])"
 
    Write-Host "DNTs left for new assignments: $($maxdnts - $root.approximateHighestInternalObjectID[0]) from $maxdnts"
}
 
else
{ Write-Host "approximateHighestInternalObjectID not exposed (DC OsVer: $osverstring)" }
```

## Maximum number of security identifiers

The maximum number of security identifiers that you can create over the lifetime of a domain controller is 2,147,483,647 relative identifiers (RIDs). For more information about issuing and monitoring RIDs, see [Managing RID Issuance](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj574229.aspx).

This limit is due to the size of the global relative identifier (RID) pool that makes each SID assigned to user, group, and computer accounts in a domain unique. RIDs aren't reused even if you delete their security principals, so the maximum limit always applies no matter how many security principals are in the domain.

>[!NOTE]
>RIDs are assigned in blocks of 500 by default from the domain controller that holds the RID operations master role in each domain. If you demote a domain controller, the unused RIDs originally allocated to the domain controller don't return to the global RID pool and become unavailable for use in the domain.

Windows Server begins to prepare an artificial limit for RID issuance when the number of available RIDs reaches 90 percent of the available global RID space. When the number of available RIDs comes within one percent of that limit, domain controllers that request RID pools receive the Directory-Services-SAM warning event 16656 in their System event log.

A partial workaround to the RID limit is creating an extra domain for holding accounts and then migrating accounts to that new domain. However, you must create any required trust relationships for the new domain before you reach the limit. Creating a trust relationship requires a security principle, also known as a trust user account.

>[!NOTE]
> The Active Directory database doesn't set limits on the number of objects in a container, but it does set limits when you work with many thousands of objects. Microsoft configured these limits to provide a certain level of application or service availability. You can adjust these limits by either reconfiguring Filter Options settings on the View menu or changing the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) policies. For more information, see [KB 315071](/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/view-set-ldap-policy-using-ntdsutil).

## Maximum Number of entries in discretionary and security access control lists

This limitation applies to how many entries you can have in a discretionary access control list (DACL) or a security access control list (SACL) of an Active Directory object using the ntSecurityDescriptor attribute. The limit itself is based on the size limitations of the access control list (ACL), which is 64 thousand. Because access control entries (ACEs) can vary in size due to containing one or more Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), the actual maximum number of entries (SIDs) can be between 1,100 and 1,820. For more information, see [How Security Descriptors and Access Control Lists Work](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc781716(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

## Group Memberships for security principals

Security principals, such as user, group, and computer accounts, can be members of a maximum of 1,015 groups. This limitation is because the access token that you create for each security principal has a size limit that isn't affected by how you nest the groups. For more information, see [KB 328889](/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/logging-on-user-account-fails).

For more information about how a domain controller creates the data structure that's used for authorization decisions, see the following articles:

- [MS-PAC: Privilege Attribute Certificate Data Structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc237917(PROT.13).aspx)

- [Initial Population of the PAC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc233956(PROT.13).aspx)

- [Domain Local Group Membership](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc233950(PROT.13).aspx)

## FQDN length limitations

Fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) in Active Directory can't exceed 64 characters in total length, including hyphens and periods. This limitation exists because the Win32 application programming interfaces (APIs) and Group Policy objects (GPOs) stored in the SYSVOL share define the MAX_PATH value as 260 characters. For more information, see [KB 909264](/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/naming-conventions-for-computer-domain-site-ou).

## Filename and path limitations

The physical files that Active Directory components use, such as SYSVOL, database (NTDS.DIT), and log file paths, are limited by the MAX_PATH length of 260 characters, as defined by the Win32 APIs. When deciding where to place your SYSVOL and database files during Active Directory installation, avoid nested folder structures that make the full file path to any physical files in your Active Directory longer than 260 characters.

## Other name length limitations

The following name length limits, which are described in [KB 909264](/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/naming-conventions-for-computer-domain-site-ou), also apply to resource and file names in Active Directory:

- NetBIOS computer and domain names can only be 15 characters long.

- Domain Name System (DNS) host names can only be 24 characters long.

- OU names can only be 64 characters long.

## Name length limits from the schema

The schema imposes the following default limits on attribute names for Active Directory objects:

- Display names can only be 256 characters long, as described in [Display-Name Attribute](/windows/win32/adschema/a-displayname).

- Common names can only be 64 characters long, as described in [Common-Name Attribute](/windows/win32/adschema/a-cn).

- The SAM-Account-Name attribute can only be 256 characters long in the schema. However, for backward compatibility, the Active Directory limit for users is 20 characters. For more information, see [SAM-Account-Name Attribute](/windows/win32/adschema/a-samaccountname).

## Name length limitations for LDAP simple bind operations

During binds to the directory, simple LDAP bind operations limit the distinguished name (DN) for the user to 255 characters. If you attempt a simple LDAP bind with more than 255 characters, you might encounter the following authentication errors:

```text
Error <49>: ldap_simple_bind_s() failed: Invalid Credentials
Server error: 80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C0903AA, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 57, v1771
Error 0x80090308 The token supplied to the function is invalid
```

You can avoid this issue by ensuring that the applications, scripts, and utilities that attempt to bind to your directory use secure LDAP binds. You can also try reducing the depth of the OU structure or the length of the OU names. For example, the following distinguished name is 261 characters:

```text
CN=BobKelly,OU=CorporateVicePresidents,OU=CorporateOfficers,OU=ViewOfPugetSoundOffices,OU=TopFloor,OU=Building1557,OU=CorporateCampus,OU=Redmond,OU=Washington,OU=NorthWestern,OU=UnitedStatesOfAmerica,OU=NorthAmerica,DC=BusinessGroup,DC=humongousinsurance,DC=com
```

If you shorten the OU named `CorporateVicePresidents` to `CVP`, the distinguished name for the `BobKelly` user account is now only 242 characters and is therefore within the limit.

## Maximum number of GPOs applied

Active Directory limits the number of GPOs that you can apply to a user or computer account to 999. This limit doesn't mean the total number of policy settings on the system is limited to 999. Instead, a single user or computer can't process more than 999 GPOs. This limitation exists to prevent performance issues caused by processing too many GPOs at the same time.

## Trust limitations

Trust limitations apply to the number of trusted domain objects (TDOs), the length of trust paths, and the ability of clients to discover available trusts. The trust limitations for Active Directory include the following limits:

- Kerberos clients can traverse as many as 10 trust links to locate a requested resource in another domain. If the trust path between the domains exceeds this limit, the attempt to access the domain fails.

- When a client searches out a trust path, the search is limited to trusts established directly with a domain and trusts that are transitive within a forest.

- Testing shows that the increased time to complete TDO-related operations, such as authentication across domains, deteriorates performance noticeably if the Active Directory implementation in an organization contains more than 2,400 TDOs.

For more information about trust limitations, see [Practical limitations of trusts](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc773178(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#practical-limitations-of-trusts).

## Maximum number of accounts per LDAP transaction

When you write scripts or design applications that perform LDAP transactions, we recommend that you perform no more than 5,000 operations per LDAP transaction. An LDAP transaction is a group of directory operations that are treated as one unit, such as add, delete, and modify. If you perform more than 5,000 operations in one LDAP transaction, you risk running into resource limits and an operational timeout. If you run into that issue, all operations in the transaction are rolled back, causing you to lose any changes made during the transaction. To learn more about the LDAP data structure that commits changes, see [LDAPModA Structure](/windows/win32/api/winldap/ns-winldap-ldapmoda).

## Recommended maximum number of users in a group

For Windows 2000 Active Directory environments, the recommended maximum number of members in a group is 5,000. This recommendation is based on the number of concurrent atomic changes that can be committed in a single database transaction.

Starting with Windows Server 2003, the ability to replicate discrete changes to linked multivalued properties was introduced as a technology called Linked Value Replication (LVR). To enable LVR, you must increase the forest functional level to at least Windows Server 2003 interim. Increasing the forest functional level changes the way that group membership (and other linked multivalued attributes) is stored in the database and replicated between domain controllers. This allows the number of group memberships to exceed the former recommended limit of 5,000 for Windows 2000 or Windows Server 2003 at a forest functional level of Windows 2000.

So far, testing in this area has yet to reveal any new recommended limits to the number of members in a group or any other linked multivalued attribute. Production environments have been reported to exceed 4 million members, and Microsoft scalability testing reached 500 million members.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Increasing the forest functional level to Windows Server 2003 interim or higher doesn't modify the way that existing group members are stored or replicated. To do that, you must remove the members that were added to the group before the forest functional level was increased to Windows Server 2003 and then add them back again to the appropriate groups. Any group members that you either add or remove after the forest functional level is increased will be LVR enabled, even if the group contains other members that aren't LVR enabled. For more information about linked attributes, see [Linked Attributes](/windows/win32/ad/linked-attributes). For more information about the replication process, see [How the Active Directory Replication Model Works](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc772726(v=ws.10)).

## Recommended maximum number of domains in a forest

The following table lists the recommended maximum number of domains for each domain functioning level.

| Domain functioning level | Recommended maximum number of domains |
|---|---|
| Windows 2000 Server | 800 |
| Windows Server 2003 | 1,200 |
| Windows Server 2025 | 3,000 |

The 1,200 limit for Windows Server 2003 is a limitation of multivalued, nonlinked attributes in Windows Server 2003. For more information, see "Maximum Database Record Size" in [How the Data Store Works](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc772829(v=ws.10)).

## Recommended maximum number of domain controllers in a domain

We recommend that you limit the number of domain controllers that you use per domain to 1,200. This limit ensures that you can reliably recover your SYSVOL if a disaster happens.

If you expect an Active Directory domain in your network to have more than 1,200 domain controllers, and those domain controllers host Active Directory-integrated Domain Name System (DNS) zones, we recommend that you review [KB 267855](/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/problems-with-dc-ad-integrated-dns-zones) for planning purposes.

## Recommended maximum Kerberos ticket size

The maximum recommended size for a Kerberos ticket is 48,000 bytes. You can set the ticket size by configuring the MaxTokenSize REG_DWORD value in the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Lsa\Kerberos\Parameters** registry or through Group Policy, as described in [KB 938118](/troubleshoot/windows-server/group-policy/group-policy-add-maxtokensize-registry-entry).

>[!NOTE]
>The maximum allowed value of MaxTokenSize is 65,535 bytes. If you're using Kerberos for IP Security (IPsec) key management, the limit is 65,536 bytes. However, because of the HTTP base64 encoding of authentication context tokens, we recommend that you don't set the maxTokenSize registry entry to a value larger than 48,000 bytes. Starting with Windows Server 2012, the default value of the MaxTokenSize registry entry is 48,000 bytes.

For more information about Kerberos tickets, see [Additional resources for troubleshooting Kerberos](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc758921(v=ws.10)).

## Maximum number of nonlinked attribute values

The Active Directory database stores nonlinked attribute values in a linked directory that must fit on a database page. As a result of this size requirement, the maximum limit of nonlink attributes for an object that carries only one attribute is 1,200. In Windows Server 2025 forests, you can increase the limit to as much as 3,000.

In real-world deployments, errors begin to appear when the object approaches the nonlinked attributes limit. The status code for these types of errors is 0x00000b and maps to the string "LDAP_ADMIN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED Administration limit on the server has exceeded."

For more information about the limit, see the [AD database details article](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc772829(v=ws.10)#maximum-database-record-size), [many DNS records on a single DNS name](/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/problems-with-dc-ad-integrated-dns-zones), and [Active Directory replication error 8304: The maximum size on an object has been exceeded](/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/active-directory-replication-error-8304).

## Maximum size of Active Directory objects

To change an attribute with a lot of data, you must store the new and old values in the database transaction. Storing the values lets you roll back the transaction if the database shuts down in the middle of the transaction. The maximum size of a transaction limits the total blob size of attribute value data to 5 MB.

The maximum size of the Active Directory transactions that you can perform also affects the limit of how many group members you can have before link-value replication and how many transactions in group membership changes exist.
