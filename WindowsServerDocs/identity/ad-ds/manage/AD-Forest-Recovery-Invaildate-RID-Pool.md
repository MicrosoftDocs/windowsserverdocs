# AD Forest Recovery - Invalidating the current RID pool

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2, Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2

Use the following procedure to us Windows PowerShell to invalidate the current RID pool on a domain controller. Windows PowerShell is enabled by default on Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2008 R2, but not Windows Server 2008 where it must be installed by using **Add Features**. It can be [downloaded](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=20020) to run on Windows Server 2003.

To verify the command completed successfully, check for event ID 16654 (source is Directory-Services-SAM) in the System log in Event Viewer in Windows Server 2012. Earlier versions of Windows do not log this event.

> [!NOTE]
> After you invalidate the RID pool, you will receive an error when you first attempt to create security principal (user, computer, or group). The attempt to create an object triggers a request for a new RID pool. Retry of the operation succeeds because the new RID pool will be allocated.

## To invalidate the current RID pool

- Open an elevated Windows PowerShell session, run the following command and press ENTER:

   ```powershell
   $Domain = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry
   $DomainSid = $Domain.objectSid
   $RootDSE = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry("LDAP://RootDSE")
   $RootDSE.UsePropertyCache = $false
   $RootDSE.Put("invalidateRidPool", $DomainSid.Value)
   $RootDSE.SetInfo()
   ```
