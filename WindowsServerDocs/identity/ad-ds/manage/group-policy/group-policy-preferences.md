# Group Policy preferences

Group Policy preferences enhance Group Policy by allowing administrators to configure additional settings beyond standard policy options. While both preferences and policy settings are stored in the Windows registry, policy settings take precedence and can override preferences when conflicts occur.

Windows allows you to configure settings through its user interface, where you select your preferred options and confirm your choices. These selections are stored in the registry as preferences (with a lowercase **"p"**), which are settings that users can change according to their needs. For example, mapping a network drive or setting a default home page are considered preferences. When you set a home page in your web browser, Windows remembers your choice for future sessions. In contrast, policy settings are enforced by administrators and prevent users from changing those settings. While preferences are typically managed by users, policies are used to ensure specific configurations remain unchanged.

Group Policy preferences allow administrators to deploy preferred configurations to computers and users, but don't prevent users from changing those settings. Unlike enforced Group Policy settings, preferences are applied through client-side extensions and are refreshed each time Group Policy updates. If a user modifies a setting managed by Group Policy Preferences, their change will persist only until the next Group Policy refresh, at which point the preference will revert to the value specified by the administrator. This differs from standard Group Policy, which enforces settings and blocks user changes entirely.

## Client-side extensions

Group Policy preferences consist of 20 client-side extensions that provide a wide range of configuration options for administrators. These extensions include:

## Common configurations

Most Group Policy preference items include common configuration options that let you control how and when each preference item is processed. Each client-side extension can have multiple preference items. By default, if one preference item fails, it doesn't stop the processing of other items within the same extension.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Stop processing items in this extension if an error occurs on this item** | When selected, if this preference item fails, the extension doesn't process any subsequent preference items within the same extension in the current Group Policy object (GPO). This behavior affects only the current GPO and extension, not others. Preference items are processed in order from top to bottom, so only items listed after the failed item are skipped. |
| **Run in logged-on user's security context (user policy option)** | Group Policy can apply user preference items using either the SYSTEM account or the logged-on user's account. By default, user preference items are processed under the SYSTEM account, which limits access to only system-level environment variables and resources. Selecting the **Run in logged-on user's security context** option causes the preference item to be processed using the permissions and environment of the logged-on user. <br><br> This is useful when the preference item needs access to user-specific resources, such as network drives or user environment variables, that aren't available to the SYSTEM account. Some preference extensions, like Drive Maps and Printers, automatically use the user's security context and don't require this option to be set manually. |
| **Remove this item when it is no longer applied** | By default, Group Policy Preferences don't remove settings when a Group Policy Object (GPO) no longer applies to a user or computer. Selecting **Remove this item when it is no longer applied** changes this behavior: if the preference item falls out of scope, due to item-level targeting or GPO changes, the settings previously applied by that item are removed. <br><br> This option automatically sets the action to **Replace**, so the preference extension deletes and recreates the item as needed. If the item is out of scope, its settings are deleted and not reapplied. This option isn't available if the action is set to **Delete**. |
| **Apply once and do not reapply** | By default, preference items are reapplied every time Group Policy refreshes, ensuring settings remain as configured in the Group Policy object. When you select **Apply once and do not reapply**, the preference item is applied only a single time to the user or computer. <br><br> After the initial application, Group Policy won't reapply or update the setting during future refreshes. This option is useful when you want a preference item to set a value only once and allow users or computers to modify it without it being overwritten by subsequent Group Policy updates. |

## Item-level targeting

Group Policy lets you filter which policy settings and preference items apply to users and computers. Preferences add another layer of filtering called targeting. With item-level targeting, you control whether a preference item applies to certain users or computers. You can use it to narrow the scope of individual preference items, so they only apply to the users or computers you choose. Inside a single GPO, you can have multiple preference itemsâ€”each tailored and targeted to specific users or computers.

Each targeting item evaluates to either true or false. You can add several targeting items to a preference item and pick whether to combine them with **AND** or **OR** logic. If the combined result for a preference item is false, its settings aren't applied. You can also use targeting collections to create parenthetical expressions for more complex logic.

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Battery Present** | Allows a preference item to be applied if one or more batteries are present in the processing computer. If **Is Not** is selected, applies only if no batteries are present. May detect a connected UPS as a battery. |
