# Active Directory Forest Recovery Guide

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2, Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2, Windows Server 2003

This guide contains best-practice recommendations for recovering an Active Directory® forest if forest-wide failure renders all domain controllers (DCs) in the forest incapable of functioning normally. The steps it contains serve as a template for your forest recovery plan, which you can customize for your particular environment. These steps apply to DCs that run Microsoft® Windows Server 2016, 2012 R2, 2012, 2008 R2, 2008, and 2003 operating systems.

> [!NOTE]
> Procedures that are unique for DCs that run Windows Server 2003 are consolidated in [AD Forest Recovery Windows Server 2003](AD-Forest-Recovery-Windows-Server-2003.md).
