# Identify the problem

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2, Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2

When symptoms of a forest-wide failure appear, such as in event logs or other monitoring solutions, work with Microsoft Support to determine the cause of the failure, and evaluate any possible remedies.

## Examples of forest-wide failures

- All DCs have been logically corrupted or physically damaged to a point that business continuity is impossible; for example, all business applications that depend on AD DS are nonfunctional.
- A rogue administrator has compromised the Active Directory environment.
- An attacker intentionally—or an administrator accidentally—runs a script that spreads data corruption across the forest.
- An attacker intentionally—or an administrator accidentally—extends the Active Directory schema with malicious or conflicting changes.
- An attacker has managed to install malicious software on DCs, and you have been advised by Microsoft Support to recover the forest from backup.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >  This paper does not cover security recommendations about how to recover a forest that has been hacked or compromised. In general, it is recommended to follow Pass-the-Hash mitigation techniques to harden the environment. For more information, see [Mitigating Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks and Other Credential Theft Techniques](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=36036).

- None of the DCs can replicate with their replication partners.
- Changes cannot be made to AD DS at any domain controller.
- New DCs cannot be installed in any domain.
