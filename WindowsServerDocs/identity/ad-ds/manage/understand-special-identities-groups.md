# Special identity groups

> Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

Learn about Windows Server special identity groups (sometimes called *security groups*) that are used for Windows access control.

## What is a special identity group?

Special identity groups are similar to the Active Directory security groups that are listed in the Active Directory Users and BuiltIn containers. Special identity groups can provide an efficient way to assign access to resources in your network. By using special identity groups, you can:

- Assign user rights to security groups in Active Directory.

- Assign permissions to security groups to access resources.

## How special identity groups work in Windows Server

If a server is running one of the versions of the Windows Server operating system shown in **Applies to** at the beginning of this article, the server has several special identity groups. These special identity groups don't have specific memberships that you can modify, but they can represent different users at different times depending on the circumstances.

Although you can assign rights and permissions for specific resources to a special identity group, you can't view or modify the membership of a special identity group. Group scopes don't apply to special identity groups. Users are automatically assigned to special identity groups when they sign in or access a specific resource.

For information about Active Directory security groups and group scopes, see [Active Directory security groups](understand-security-groups.md).

### Creator Group

The person who created a file or directory is a member of this special identity group. The Windows Server operating system uses this identity to automatically grant access permissions to the creator of a file or directory.

A placeholder SID is created in an inheritable access control entry (ACE). When the ACE is inherited, the system replaces this SID with the SID for the primary group of the object’s current owner. The primary group is used only by the POSIX subsystem.

|Attribute|Value|

### Enterprise Read-only Domain Controllers

This group includes all Read-only Domain Controllers (RODC) in an Active Directory forest. An Enterprise RODC can replicate a larger subset of the Active Directory database, including the global catalog and read-only domain partitions for all domains in the forest. Membership is controlled by the operating system.

|Attribute|Value|
| --- | --- |
|Well-known SID/RID|S-1-5-21-\<RootDomain>-498|
|Object class|Group|
|Default location in Active Directory |CN=Users, DC=\<forestRootDomain\>|
|Default user rights|None|

### Everyone

All interactive, network, dial-up, and authenticated users are members of the Everyone group. This special identity group gives wide access to system resources. When a user logs on to the network, the user is automatically added to the Everyone group. Membership is controlled by the operating system.

On computers running Windows 2000 and earlier, the Everyone group included the Anonymous Logon group as a default member. Beginning in Windows Server 2003, the Everyone group contains only Authenticated Users and Guest. The group no longer includes Anonymous Logon by default. To change the Everyone group setting to include the Anonymous Logon group, in Registry Editor, go to the **Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa** key and set the value of the **everyoneincludesanonymous** DWORD to **1**.

|Object class|Foreign Security Principal|
|Default location in Active Directory |CN=WellKnown Security Principals, CN=Configuration, DC=\<forestRootDomain\>|
|Default user rights|None|

### Interactive

Any user who is logged on to the local system has the Interactive identity. This identity allows only local users to access a resource. When a user accesses a specific resource on the computer to which they're currently logged on, the user is automatically added to the Interactive group. Membership is controlled by the operating system.

### LocalSystem

The LocalSystem account is a service account that's used by the operating system. The LocalSystem account is a powerful account that has full access to the system and acts as the computer on the network. If a service logs on to the LocalSystem account on a domain controller, that service has access to the entire domain. Some services are configured by default to log on to the LocalSystem account. Don't change the default service setting. The name of the account is LocalSystem. This account doesn't have a password.

|Attribute|Value|
| --- | --- |
|Well-known SID/RID|S-1-5-18|

### Network Service

The Network Service account is similar to the Authenticated User account. Members of the Network Service account have the same level of access to resources and objects as members of the Users group. This limited access helps safeguard your system if individual services or processes are compromised. Services that run as the Network Service account access network resources by using the credentials of the computer account. The name of the account is NT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService. This account doesn't have a password.

### Principal Self

This identity is a placeholder in an ACE on a user, group, or computer object in Active Directory. When you grant permissions to Principal Self, you grant permissions to the security principal that's represented by the object. During an access check, the operating system replaces the SID for Principal Self with the SID for the security principal that's represented by the object.

|Attribute|Value|
| --- | --- |
|Well-known SID/RID|S-1-5-10 |
|Object class|Foreign Security Principal|

|Default user rights|None|

### Read-only Domain Controllers

This group includes all RODCs in the domain with read-only rights to the Active Directory database. Except for account passwords, a RODC holds all the Active Directory objects and attributes that a writable domain controller holds. It allows domain controller deployment when physical security is scarce or not guaranteed. RODCs are explicit members of this group.
