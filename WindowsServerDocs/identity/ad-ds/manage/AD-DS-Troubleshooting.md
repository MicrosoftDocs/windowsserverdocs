# AD DS Troubleshooting

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2

This section includes troubleshooting recommendations and procedures for diagnosing and fixing problems that may occur with Active Directory replication.

This content focuses primarily on responses to Directory Service event log messages and tool-based error messages that might be reported by the Repadmin.exe and Dcdiag.exe tools. These tools are available on all domain controllers that are running Windows Server 2016 or 2012 R2. You can also install Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) on a member server that is running Windows 10.

For information about installing RSAT, see the article [Remote Server Administration Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-server-administration-tools).
