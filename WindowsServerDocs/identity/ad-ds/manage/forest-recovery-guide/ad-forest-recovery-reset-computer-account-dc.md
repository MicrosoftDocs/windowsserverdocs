# Active Directory Forest Recovery - Reset the computer account on the recovered DC

 Use the following procedure to reset the computer account password of the Domain Controller (DC).

## Reset the computer account password of the domain controller

1. Open PowerShell as an Administrator, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

   ```cli
   Reset-ComputerMachinePassword
   ```

2. Run the same command again to ensure other Domain Controllers from before the Forest Recovery can't replicate from it.

> [!WARNING]
> This should only be carried out on the sole recovered DC during a forest recovery exercise.
> Using this command <i>will</i> break replication with other DCs.
