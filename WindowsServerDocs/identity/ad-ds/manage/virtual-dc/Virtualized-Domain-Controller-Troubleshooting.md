## <a name="BKMK_Intro"></a>Introduction
The most important way to improve your troubleshooting skills is build a test lab and rigorously examine normal, working scenarios. If you encounter errors, they are more obvious and easy to understand, since you then have a solid foundation of how domain controller promotion works. This also allows you to build your analysis and network analysis skills. This goes for all distributed systems technologies, not just virtualized domain controller deployment.

The critical elements to advanced troubleshooting of domain controller configuration are:

1. Linear analysis combined with focus and attention to detail.

2. Understanding network capture analysis

3. Understanding the built-in logs

The first and second are beyond the scope of this topic, but the third can be explained in some detail. Virtualized domain controller troubleshooting requires a logical and linear method. The key is to approach the issue using the data provided and only resort to complex tools and analysis when you have exhausted the provided output and logging.

### <a name="BKMK_Tools"></a>Tools for Troubleshooting

#### <a name="BKMK_LoggingOptions"></a>Logging Options

The built-in logs are the most important tool for troubleshooting issues with domain controller cloning. All of these logs are enabled and configured for maximum verbosity, by default.

| **Operation** | **Log** |
|--|--|
| **Cloning** | - Event viewer\Windows logs\System<br />- Event viewer\Applications and services logs\Directory Service<br />- %systemroot%\debug\dcpromo.log |
| **Promotion** | - %systemroot%\debug\dcpromo.log<br />- Event viewer\Applications and services logs\Directory Service<br />- Event viewer\Windows logs\System<br />- Event viewer\Applications and services logs\File Replication Service<br />- Event viewer\Applications and services logs\DFS Replication |

#### Tools and Commands for Troubleshooting Domain Controller Configuration
To troubleshoot issues not explained by the logs, use the following tools as a starting point:

- Dcdiag.exe

- Repadmin.exe

- Network Monitor 3.4

### <a name="BKMK_GeneralMethodology"></a>General Methodology for Troubleshooting Domain Controller Cloning

1. Is the VM booting into DS Repair Mode (DSRM)? This indicates troubleshooting is necessary. To log on in DSRM, use **.\Administrator** account and specify the DSRM password.

    1. Examine the Dcpromo.log.

        1. Did initial cloning steps succeed but domain controller promotion fail?

        2. Do errors indicate issues with the local domain controller or with the AD DS environment, such as errors returned from the PDC emulator?

    2. Examine the System and Directory Services event logs and the dccloneconfig.xml and CustomDCCloneAllowList.xml

        1. Does an incompatible application need to be in the CustomDCCloneAllowList.xml allow list?

        2. Is the IP address or computer name either duplicated or invalid in the dccloneconfig.xml?

        3. Is the Active Directory site invalid in the dccloneconfig.xml?

        4. Is the IP address not set in the dccloningconfig.xml and there is no DHCP server available?

        5. Is the PDC emulator online and available through the RPC protocol?

        6. Is the domain controller a member of the Cloneable Domain Controllers group? Is the permission **Allow a DC to create a clone of itself** set on the domain root for that group?

        7. Does the Dccloneconfig.xml file contain syntax errors that prevent correct parsing?

        8. Is the hypervisor supported?

        9. Did domain controller promotion fail after cloning began successfully?

        10. Was the maximum number of auto-generated domain controller names (9999) exceeded?

        11. Is the MAC address duplicated?

2. Is host name of the clone the same as the source DC?

    1. Is there a Dccloneconfig.xml file in one of the allowed locations?

3. Is the VM booting into normal mode and cloning completed, but the domain controller is not functioning correctly?

    1. First check if the host name is changed on the clone. If the host name is different, cloning has at least partially completed.

    2. Does the domain controller have a duplicate IP address of the source domain controller from the dccloneconfig.xml, but the source domain controller was offline during cloning?

    3. If the domain controller is advertising, treat the issue as any normal post-promotion issue you would have without cloning.

    4. If the domain controller is not advertising, examine the Directory Service, System, Application, File Replication and DFS Replication event logs for post-promotion errors.

#### Disabling DSRM Boot
Once booted into DSRM due to any error, diagnose the cause for failure and if the dcpromo.log does not indicate that cloning cannot be retried, fix the cause for failure and reset the DSRM flag. A failed clone does not return to normal mode on its own on the next reboot; you must remove the DS Restore Mode boot flag in order to try cloning again. All of these steps require running as an elevated administrator.

##### Removing DSRM with Msconfig.exe
To turn DSRM boot off using a GUI, use the System Configuration tool:

1. Run msconfig.exe

2. On the **Boot** tab, under **Boot Options**, de-select **Safe boot** (it is already selected with the option **Active Directory repair** enabled)

3. Click OK and restart when prompted

##### Removing DSRM with Bcdedit.exe
To turn DSRM boot off from the command-line, use the Boot Configuration Data Store Editor:

1. Open a CMD prompt and run:

    ```
    Bcdedit.exe /deletevalue safeboot
    ```

2. Restart the computer with:

    ```
    Shutdown.exe /t /0 /r
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Bcdedit.exe also works in a Windows PowerShell console. The commands there are:
>
> Bcdedit.exe /deletevalue safeboot
>
> Restart-computer

### <a name="BKMK_ServerCoreEvents"></a>Server Core and the Event Log
The event logs contain much of the useful information about virtualized domain controller cloning operations. By default, a Windows Server 2012 computer installation is a Server Core installation, which means there is no graphical interface and therefore, no way to run the local Event Viewer snap-in.

To review the event logs on a server running a Server Core installation:

- Run the Wevtutil.exe tool locally

- Run PowerShell cmdlet Get-WinEvent locally

- If you have enabled the Windows Advanced Firewall rules for the "Remote Event Log Management" groups (or equivalent ports) to allow inbound communication, you can manage the event log remotely using Eventvwr.exe, wevtutil.exe, or Get-Winevent. This can be done on Server Core installation using NETSH.exe, Group Policy, or the new Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not attempt to add the graphical shell back to the computer while it is in DSRM. Windows servicing stack (CBS) cannot operate correctly while in Safe Mode or DSRM. Attempts to add features or roles while in DSRM will not complete and leave the computer in an unstable state until it is booted normally. Since a virtualized domain controller clone in DSRM cannot boot normally, and should not be booted normally under most circumstances, it is impossible to safely add the graphical shell. Doing so is unsupported and may leave you with an unusable server.

### <a name="BKMK_SpecificProblems"></a>Troubleshooting Specific Problems

#### Events
All virtualized domain controller cloning events write to the Directory Services event log of the clone domain controller VM. The Application, File Replication Service, and DFS Replication event logs may also contain useful troubleshooting information for failed cloning. Failures during the RPC call to the PDC emulator may be available in the event log on the PDC emulator.

Below are the Windows Server 2012 cloning-specific events in the Directory Services event log, with notes and suggested resolutions for errors.

##### Error Messages
There are no direct interactive errors for failed virtualized domain controller cloning; all cloning information logs in the System and Directory Services logs and the domain controller promotion logs in dcpromo.log. However, if the server boots into DS Restore Mode, investigate immediately, as promotion or cloning failed.

The dcpromo.log is the first place to check for cloning failure. Depending on the failure listed, it may be necessary to subsequently review Directory Services and System logs for further diagnosis.

#### Known Issues and Support Scenarios
The following are common issues seen during the Windows Server 2012 development process. All of these issues are "by design" and have either a valid workaround or more appropriate technique to avoid them in the first place. Some may be resolved in later releases of Windows Server 2012.

|**Issue**|**Cloning fails, DSRM**|
| -- |--|
|**Symptoms**|Clone boots into Directory Services Restore Mode|
|**Resolution and Notes**|Validate all steps followed from sections Deploying Virtualized Domain Controller section and [General Methodology for Troubleshooting Domain Controller Cloning](../../../ad-ds/manage/virtual-dc/Virtualized-Domain-Controller-Troubleshooting.md#BKMK_GeneralMethodology)<p>Described in KB 2742844.|

|**Issue**|**Extra IP leases when using DHCP to clone**|
| -- |--|
|**Symptoms**|After successfully cloning a DC and using DHCP, the first boot of the clone takes a DHCP lease. Then when the server is renamed and restarted as a DC, it takes a second DHCP lease. The first IP address is not released and you end up with a "phantom" lease|
|**Resolution and Notes**|Manually delete the unused address lease in DHCP or allow it to expire normally. Described in KB 2742836.|

|**Issue**|**Cloning fails into DSRM after very long delay**|
| -- |--|
|**Symptoms**|Cloning appears to pause at "Domain controller cloning is at X% completion" for between 8 and 15 minutes. After this, the cloning fails and boots into DSRM.|
|**Resolution and Notes**|The cloned computer cannot get a dynamic IP address from DHCP or SLAAC, or is using a duplicate IP address, or cannot find the PDC. Multiple retry attempts performed by cloning lead to the delay. Resolve the networking issue to allow cloning.<p>Described in KB 2742844.|

|**Issue**|**Cloning does not recreate all service principal names**|
| -- |--|
|**Symptoms**|If a set of *three-part* service principal names (SPN) includes both a NetBIOS name with a port and an otherwise identical NetBIOS name without a port, the non-port entry is not recreated with the new computer name. For example:<p>customspn/DC1:200/app1 INVALID USE OF SYMBOLS *this is recreated with the new computer name*<p>customspn/DC1/app1 INVALID USE OF SYMBOLS *this is not recreated with the new computer name*<p>Fully qualified names are recreated and SPNs without three parts are recreated, regardless of ports. For example, these are recreated successfully on the clone:<p>customspn/DC1:202 INVALID USE OF SYMBOLS *this is recreated*<p>customspn/DC1 INVALID USE OF SYMBOLS *this is recreated*<p>customspn/DC1.corp.contoso.com:202 INVALID USE OF SYMBOLS *this is recreated name*<p>customspn/DC1.corp.contoso.com INVALID USE OF SYMBOLS *this is recreated*|
|**Resolution and Notes**|This is a limitation of the domain controller rename process in Windows, not just in cloning. Three-part SPNS are not handled by the renaming logic in any scenario. Most included Windows services are unaffected by this, as they recreate any missing SPNs as needed. Other applications may require manually entering the SPN to resolve the issue.<p>Described in KB 2742874.|

|**Issue**|**Cloning fails, boots into DSRM, general networking errors**|
| -- |--|
|**Symptoms**|Clone boots into Directory Services Repair Mode. There are general networking errors.|
|Resolution and Notes|Ensure that the new clone does not have a duplicate static MAC address assigned from the source domain controller; you can see if a VM uses static MAC addresses by running this command on the hypervisor host for both the source and clone virtual machines:<p>Get-VM -VMName *test-vm* &#124; Get-VMNetworkAdapter &#124; fl *<p>Change the MAC address to a unique static address or switch to using dynamic MAC addresses.<p>Described in KB 2742844|

| **Issue** | **Cloning fails, boots into DSRM as a duplicate of the source DC** |
| -- |--|
| **Symptoms** | A new clone boots up without cloning. The dccloneconfig.xml is not renamed and the server starts in DS Restore Mode. The Directory Services event log shows Error 2164<p>*<COMPUTERNAME>* failed to start the DsRoleSvc service to clone the local virtual domain controller. |
| **Resolution and Notes** | Examine the service settings for the DS Role Server service (DsRoleSvc) and ensure its start type is set to Manual. Validate that no third party program is preventing the start of this service.<p>For more information about how to reclaim this secondary DC while ensuring that updates get replicated outbound, see Microsoft KB article 2742970. |

|**Issue**|**Cloning fails, boots into DSRM, error 8610**|
| -- |--|
|**Symptoms**|Clone boots into Directory Services Restore Mode. Dcpromo .log shows 8610 error (which is ERROR_DS_ROLE_NOT_VERIFIED 8610 or 0x21A2)|
|**Resolution and Notes**|Will happen if the PDC can be discoverable but it has not performed sufficient replication to allow itself to assume the role. For example, if cloning is started and another administrator moves the PDCE FSMO role to a new DC.<p>Described in KB 2742916.|

|**Issue**|**Cloning fails, boots into DSRM, general networking errors**|
| -- |--|
|**Symptoms**|Clone boots into Directory Services Restore Mode. There are general networking errors.|
|**Resolution and Notes**|Ensure that the new clone does not have a duplicate static MAC address assigned from the source domain controller; you can see if a VM uses static MAC addresses by running this command on the Hyper-V host for both the source and clone virtual machines:<p>Get-VM -VMName *test-vm* &#124; Get-VMNetworkAdapter &#124; fl *<p>Change the MAC address to a unique static address or switch to using dynamic MAC addresses.<p>Described in KB 2742844.|

|**Issue**|**Cloning fails, boots into DSRM**|
| -- |--|
|**Symptoms**|Clone boots into Directory Services Repair Mode|
|**Resolution and Notes**|Ensure that the dccloneconfig.xml contains the schema definition (see sampledccloneconfig.xml, line 2):<p>**<d3c:DCCloneConfig xmlns:d3c="uri:microsoft.com:schemas:DCCloneConfig">**<p>Described in KB 2742844|

|**Issue**|**No logon servers are available error logging into DSRM**|
| -- |--|
|**Symptoms**|Clone boots into Directory Services Repair Mode. You attempt to logon and receive error:<p>**There are currently no logon servers are available to service the logon request**|
|**Resolution and Notes**|Ensure you logon with the DSRM administrator account, and not the domain account. Use the left arrow and type a user name of:<p>**.\administrator**<p>Described in KB 2742908|

|**Issue**|**Clone Source fails into DSRM, error**|
|--|--|
|**Symptoms**|During cloning, fails 8437 "Create clone DC objects on PDC failed" (0x20f5)|
|**Resolution and Notes**|Duplicate computer name was set in DCCloneConfig.xml as the source DC or an existing DC. The computer name also needs to be in the NetBIOS computer name format (15 characters or fewer, not an FQDN).<p>Fix the dccloneconfig.xml file by setting a unique, valid name.<p>Described in KB 2742959|

|**Issue**|**New-addccloneconfigfile error "index was out of range"**|
|--|--|
|**Symptoms**|When running the new-addccloneconfigfile cmdlet, you receive error:<p>Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.|
|**Resolution and Notes**|You must run the cmdlet in an administrator-elevated Windows PowerShell console. This error is caused by lack of local administrator group membership on the computer.<p>Described in KB 2742927|

|**Issue**|**Cloning fails, duplicate DC**|
|--|--|
|**Symptoms**|Clone boots without cloning, duplicates existing source DC|
|**Resolution and Notes**|The computer was copied and started but does not contain a DcCloneConfig.xml file in any of the supported locations, and did not have a duplicate IP address with the source domain controller. The DC must be correctly removed in order to avoid data loss.<p>Described in KB 2742970|

|**Issue**|**New-ADDCCloneConfigFile fails with The server is not operational error when it checks if the source domain controller is a member of the Cloneable Domain controllers group if a GC is not available.**|
|--|--|
|**Symptoms**|When running New-ADDCCloneConfigFile to create a dccloneconfig.xml file, you receive error:<p>Code - The server is not operational|
|**Resolution and Notes**|Verify connectivity to a GC from the server where you run New-ADDCCloneConfigFile and verify that the membership of the source domain controller in the Cloneable Domain Controllers group has replicated to that GC.<p>Run the following command as a means of flushing the DC locator cache for cases where a GC or DC may have been taken offline recently:<p>Code - nltest /dsgetdc: /GC /FORCE|

### Advanced Troubleshooting
This module seeks to teach advanced troubleshooting by using *working* logs as samples, with some explanation of what occurred. If you understand what a successful virtualized domain controller operation looks like, failures become obvious in your environment. These logs are presented by their source, with the ascending order of *expected* events (even when they are warnings and errors) related to a cloned domain controller within each log.

#### Cloning a Domain Controller
In this example, the clone domain controller uses DHCP to get an IP address, replicates SYSVOL using FRS or DFSR (see the appropriate log as necessary), is a global catalog, and uses a blank dccloneconfig.xml file.

##### Directory Services Event Log
The Directory Services log contains the majority of event-based cloning operational information. The hypervisor changes the VM-Generation ID and the NTDS service notes it, then invalidates the RID pool and changes the invocation ID. The new VM-Generation ID is set and the server replicates Active Directory data inbound. The DFSR service is stopped and its database that hosts SYSVOL is deleted, forcing a non-authoritative sync inbound. The USN high watermark is adjusted.

##### System Event Log
The next indications of cloning operations are in the System Event log. As the hypervisor tells the guest computer that it was cloned or restored from a snapshot, the domain controller immediately invalidates its RID pool to avoid duplicating security principals later. As cloning proceeds, various expected operations and messages appear, mostly around services starting and stopping and some expected errors caused by this. When completed the System event log notes overall cloning success.

##### DCPROMO.LOG
The Dcpromo.log contains the actual promotion portion of cloning that the Directory Services event log does not describe. Since the log does not provide the level of explanation that the event log entries impart, this section of the module contains additional annotation.

The promotion process means that the cloning starts, the DC is scrubbed of its current configuration and re-promoted using the existing AD database (much like an IFM promotion), then the DC replicates inbound change deltas of AD and SYSVOL, and cloning is complete.

> [!NOTE]
> The log has been modified in this module for readability, by removing the date column.
>
> For further explanation of the dcpromo.log see the Understand and Troubleshoot AD DS Simplified Administration in Windows Server 2012.

##### Active Directory Web Services Event Log
While cloning is occurring, the NTDS.DIT database is often offline for extended periods. The ADWS service logs at least one event for this. After cloning is complete, the ADWS service starts, notes that there is not yet a valid computer certificate yet (there may or may not be, depending on your environment deploying a Microsoft PKI with auto-enrollment or not) and then starts the instance for the new domain controller.

|**Event ID**|**Source**|**Message**|

##### DNS Server Event Log
The DNS service will experience brief expected outages while cloning occurs, as the DNS service is still running while the AD DS database is offline. This occurs if using Active Directory Integrated DNS, but not if using Standard Primary or Secondary DNS. These errors log multiple times. After cloning completes, DNS comes back online normally.

|**Event ID**|**Source**|**Message**|
|--|--|--|
|**4013**|DNS-Server-Service|The DNS server is waiting for Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to signal that the initial synchronization of the directory has been completed. The DNS server service cannot start until the initial synchronization is complete because critical DNS data might not yet be replicated onto this domain controller. If events in the AD DS event log indicate that there is a problem with DNS name resolution, consider adding the IP address of another DNS server for this domain to the DNS server list in the Internet Protocol properties of this computer. This event will be logged every two minutes until AD DS has signaled that the initial synchronization has successfully completed.|
|**4015**|DNS-Server-Service|The DNS server has encountered a critical error from the Active Directory. Check that the Active Directory is functioning properly. The extended error debug information (which may be empty) is """". The event data contains the error.|

##### File Replication Service Event Log
The File Replication Service synchronizes non-authoritatively from a partner during cloning. Cloning accomplishes this by deleting the NTFRS database files and leaving the contents of SYSVOL untouched, for use as pre-seeded data. The two attempts to synchronize are expected.

| **Event ID** | **Source** | **Message** |
|--|--|--|
| **13562** | NtFrs | Following is the summary of warnings and errors encountered by File Replication Service while polling the Domain Controller DC2.root.fabrikam.com for FRS replica set configuration information.<p>Could not bind to a Domain Controller. Will try again at next polling cycle |
| **13502** | NtFrs | The File Replication Service is stopping. |

##### DFS Replication Event Log
The DFSR services synchronizes non-authoritatively from a partner during cloning. Cloning accomplishes this by deleting the DFSR database files and leaving the contents of SYSVOL untouched, for use as pre-seeded data. The two attempts to synchronize are expected.

### Tools for Troubleshooting

#### Logging Options
The built-in logs are the most important tool for troubleshooting issues with domain controller safe snapshot restore. All of these logs are enabled and configured for maximum verbosity, by default.

|**Operation**|**Log**|
|--|--|
|**Snapshot creation**|- Event viewer\Applications and services logs\Microsoft\Windows\Hyper-V-Worker|
|**Snapshot restore**|- Event viewer\Applications and services logs\Directory Service<br />- Event viewer\Windows logs\System<br />- Event viewer\Windows logs\Application<br />- Event viewer\Applications and services logs\File Replication Service<br />- Event viewer\Applications and services logs\DFS Replication<br />- Event viewer\Applications and services logs\DNS<br />- Event viewer\Applications and services logs\Microsoft\Windows\Hyper-V-Worker|

#### Tools and Commands for Troubleshooting Domain Controller Configuration
To troubleshoot issues not explained by the logs, use the following tools as a starting point:

- Dcdiag.exe

- Repadmin.exe

- Network Monitor 3.4

#### <a name="BKMK_TshhotSafeRestore"></a>General Methodology for Troubleshooting Domain Controller Safe Restore

1. Is the safe snapshot restore expected, but having issues?

    1. Examine the Directory Services event log

        1. Are there snapshot restore errors?

        2. Are there AD replication errors?

    2. Examine the System event log

        1. Are there communication errors?

        2. Are there AD errors?

2. Is the safe snapshot restore unexpected?

    1. Examine the hypervisor audit logs to determine who or what caused a rollback

    2. Contact all administrators of the hypervisor and interrogate them as to who rolled back the VM without notification

3. Is the server implementing USN rollback protection and not safely restoring?

    1. Examine the Directory Services event log for an unsupported hypervisor or integration services

    2. Examine the operating system and validate running Windows Server 2012?

### <a name="BKMK_TshootSpecificSafeRestore"></a>Troubleshooting Specific Problems

#### Events
All virtualized domain controller safe snapshot restore events write to the Directory Services event log of the restored domain controller VM. The Application, System, File Replication Service, and DFS Replication event logs may also contain useful troubleshooting information for failed restores.

Below are the Windows Server 2012 safe restore-specific events in the Directory Services event log.

#### Error Messages
There are no direct interactive errors for failed virtualized domain controller safe snapshot restore; all cloning information logs in the Directory Services event logs. Naturally, any critical replication or server advertising errors manifest themselves as symptoms elsewhere.

#### Known Issues and Support Scenarios
The [General Methodology for Troubleshooting Domain Controller Safe Restore](../../../ad-ds/manage/virtual-dc/Virtualized-Domain-Controller-Troubleshooting.md#BKMK_TshootSpecificSafeRestore) are usually adequate to troubleshoot most issues.

|**Issue**|**Cannot create new security principals on recently safe restored domain controller**|
| -- |--|
|**Symptoms**|After restoring a snapshot, attempts to create a new security principal (user, computer, group) on that domain controller fail with:<p>Error 0x2010<p>The directory service was unable to allocate a relative identifier.|
|**Resolution and Notes**|This issue is caused by the restored computer's stale knowledge of the RID Master FSMO role. If the role moved to this or another domain controller after a snapshot was taken and then later restored, the restored domain controller will not have knowledge of the RID master until initial replication has completed.<p>To resolve the issue, allow AD replication to complete inbound to the restored domain controller. If still not working, validate that all domain controllers have the same correct knowledge of which DC hosts the RID Master.|

|**Issue**|**Restored domain controllers do not share SYSVOL, advertise**|
| -- |--|
|**Symptoms**|After restoring a snapshot, one or more DCs do not advertise, do not share sysvol, and do not have up to date SYSVOL contents|
|**Resolution and Notes**|The DC's upstream partners do not have a working SYSVOL replica that is correctly replicating with DFSR or FRS. This issue is unrelated to safe restore but is likely to manifest as a  safe restore issue, because the customer was unaware of the other replication issue affecting un-restored DCs|

### Advanced Troubleshooting
This module seeks to teach advanced troubleshooting by using *working* logs as samples, with some explanation of what occurred. If you understand what a successful virtualized domain controller operation looks like, failures become obvious in your environment. These logs are presented by their source, with the ascending order of *expected* events related to a cloned domain controller within each log.

#### Restoring a Domain Controller that Replicates SYSVOL Using DFSR

##### Directory Services Event Log
The Directory Services log contains the majority of safe restore operational information. The hypervisor changes the VM-Generation ID and the NTDS service notes it, then invalidates the RID pool and changes the invocation ID. The new VM-Generation ID is set and the servers replicates AD data inbound. The DFSR service is stopped and its database that hosts SYSVOL is deleted, forcing a non-authoritative sync inbound. The USN high watermark is adjusted.

##### DFS Replication Event Log
The DFSR service is stopped and the database that contains SYSVOL is deleted, forcing a non-authoritative synchronization inbound.

| **Event ID** | **Source** | **Message** |

| **4614** | DFSR | The DFS Replication service initialized SYSVOL at local path C:\Windows\SYSVOL\domain and is waiting to perform initial replication. The replicated folder will remain in the initial synchronization state until it has replicated with its partner. If the server was in the process of being promoted to a domain controller, the domain controller will not advertise and function as a domain controller until this issue is resolved. This can occur if the specified partner is also in the initial synchronization state, or if sharing violations are encountered on this server or the synchronization partner. If this event occurred during the migration of SYSVOL from File Replication Service (FRS) to DFS Replication, changes will not replicate out until this issue is resolved. This can cause the SYSVOL folder on this server to become out of sync with other domain controllers.<p>Additional Information:<p>Replicated Folder Name: SYSVOL Share<p>Replicated Folder ID: *<GUID>*<p>Replication Group Name: Domain System Volume<p>Replication Group ID: *<GUID>*<p>Member ID: *<GUID>*<p>Read-Only: 0 |
| **4604** | DFSR | The DFS Replication service successfully initialized the SYSVOL replicated folder at local path C:\Windows\SYSVOL\domain. This member has completed initial synchronization of SYSVOL with partner dc1.corp.contoso.com.

#### Restoring a Domain Controller that Replicates SYSVOL Using FRS
The File Replication Event log is used instead of the DFSR event log in this case. The Application event log also writes different FRS-related events. Otherwise, the Directory Services and System Event log messages are generally the same and in the same order as previously described.

##### File Replication Service Event Log
The FRS service is stopped and restarted with a D2 BURFLAGS value to non-authoritatively synchronize SYSVOL.

##### Application Event Log
The FRS database stops and starts, and is purged due to the D2 BURFLAGS operation.
