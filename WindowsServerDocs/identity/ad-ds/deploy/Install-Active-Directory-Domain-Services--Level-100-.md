## <a name="BKMK_Creds"></a>Credential requirements to run Adprep.exe and install Active Directory Domain Services
The following credentials are required to run Adprep.exe and install AD DS.

-   To install a new forest, you must be logged on as the local Administrator for the computer.

-   To install a new child domain or new domain tree, you must be logged on as a member of the Enterprise Admins group.

-   To install an additional domain controller in an existing domain, you must be a member of the Domain Admins group.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not run adprep.exe command separately and you are installing the first domain controller that runs  Windows Server 2012  in an existing domain or forest, you will be prompted to supply credentials to run Adprep commands. The credential requirements are as follows:
    >
    > -   To introduce the first  Windows Server 2012  domain controller in the forest, you need to supply credentials for a member of Enterprise Admins group, the Schema Admins group, and the Domain Admins group in the domain that hosts the schema master.
    > -   To introduce the first  Windows Server 2012  domain controller in a domain, you need to supply credentials for a member of the Domain Admins group.
    > -   To introduce the first read-only domain controller (RODC) in the forest, you need to supply credentials for a member of the Enterprise Admins group.
    >
    >     > [!NOTE]
    >     > If you have already run adprep /rodcprep in Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2, you do not need to run it again for  Windows Server 2012 .

## <a name="BKMK_PS"></a>Installing AD DS by Using Windows PowerShell
Beginning with  Windows Server 2012 , you can install AD DS using Windows PowerShell. Dcpromo.exe is deprecated beginning with  Windows Server 2012 , but you can still run dcpromo.exe by using an answer file (dcpromo /unattend:<answerfile> or dcpromo /answer:<answerfile>). The ability to continue running dcpromo.exe with an answer file provides organizations that have resources invested in existing automation time to convert the automation from dcpromo.exe to Windows PowerShell. For more information about running dcpromo.exe with an answer file, see [https://support.microsoft.com/kb/947034](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/947034).

For more information about removing AD DS using Windows PowerShell, see [Remove AD DS using Windows PowerShell](assetId:///99b97af0-aa7e-41ed-8c81-4eee6c03eb4c#BKMK_RemovePS).

Start with adding the role using Windows PowerShell. This command installs the AD DS server role and installs the AD DS and AD LDS server administration tools, including GUI-based tools such as Active Directory Users and Computers and command-line tools such as dcdia.exe. Server administration tools are not installed by default when you use Windows PowerShell. You need to specify **"IncludeManagementTools** to manage the local server or install [Remote Server Administration Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=28972) to manage a remote server.

```
Install-windowsfeature -name AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools
<<Windows PowerShell cmdlet and arguments>>
```

There is no reboot required until after the AD DS installation is complete.

You can then run this command to see the available cmdlets in the ADDSDeployment module.

```
Get-Command -Module ADDSDeployment
```

To see the list of arguments that can be specified for a cmdlets and syntax:

```
Get-Help <cmdlet name>
```

For example, to see the arguments for creating an unoccupied read-only domain controller (RODC) account, type

```
Get-Help Add-ADDSReadOnlyDomainControllerAccount
```

Optional arguments appear in square brackets.

You can also download the latest Help examples and concepts for Windows PowerShell cmdlets. For more information, see [about_Updatable_Help](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_updatable_help?view=powershell-5.1&preserve-view=true).

You can run Windows PowerShell cmdlets against remote servers:

-   In Windows PowerShell, use Invoke-Command with the ADDSDeployment cmdlet. For example, to install AD DS on a remote server named ConDC3 in the contoso.com domain, type:

    ```
    Invoke-Command { Install-ADDSDomainController -DomainName contoso.com -Credential (Get-Credential) } -ComputerName ConDC3
    ```

-or-

-   In Server Manager, create a server group that includes the remote server. Right-click the name of the remote server and click **Windows PowerShell**.

### <a name="BKMK_Params"></a>ADDSDeployment cmdlet arguments
The following table lists arguments for the ADDSDeployment cmdlets in Windows PowerShell. Arguments in bold are required. Equivalent arguments for dcpromo.exe are listed in parentheses if they are named different in Windows PowerShell.

Windows PowerShell switches accept $TRUE or $FALSE arguments. Arguments that are $TRUE by default do not need to be specified.

To override default values, you can specify the argument with a $False value. For example, because **-installdns** is automatically run for a new forest installation if it is not specified, the only way to *prevent* DNS installation when you install a new forest is to use:

```
-InstallDNS:$false
```

Similarly, because **"installdns** has a default value of $False if you install a domain controller in an environment that does not host Windows Server DNS server, you need to specify the following argument in order to install DNS server:

```
-InstallDNS:$true
```

### <a name="BKMK_PSCreds"></a>Specifying Windows PowerShell Credentials
You can specify credentials without revealing them in plain text on screen by using [Get-credential](/previous-versions/dd315327(v=technet.10)).

The operation for the -SafeModeAdministratorPassword and LocalAdministratorPassword arguments is special:

-   If not specified as an argument, the cmdlet prompts you to enter and confirm a masked password. This is the preferred usage when running the cmdlet interactively.

-   If specified with a value, the value must be a secure string. This is not the preferred usage when running the cmdlet interactively.

For example, you can manually prompt for a password by using the **Read-Host** cmdlet to prompt the user for a secure string

```
-SafeModeAdministratorPassword (Read-Host -Prompt "DSRM Password:" -AsSecureString)
```

> [!WARNING]
> As the previous option does not confirm the password, use extreme caution: the password is not visible.

You can also provide a secure string as a converted clear-text variable, although this is highly discouraged:

```
-SafeModeAdministratorPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "Password1" -AsPlainText -Force)
```

> [!WARNING]
> Providing or storing a clear text password is not recommended. Anyone running this command in a script or looking over your shoulder knows the DSRM password of that domain controller. With that knowledge, they can impersonate the domain controller itself and elevate their privilege to the highest level in an Active Directory forest.

### <a name="BKMK_TestCmdlets"></a>Using test cmdlets
Each ADDSDeployment cmdlet has a corresponding test cmdlet. The test cmdlets runs only the prerequisite checks for the installation operation; no installation settings are configured. The arguments for each test cmdlet are the same as for the corresponding installation cmdlet, but **"SkipPreChecks** is not available for test cmdlets.

|Test cmdlet|Description|
|---------------|---------------|
|Test-ADDSForestInstallation|Runs the prerequisites for installing a new Active Directory forest.|
|Test-ADDSDomainInstallation|Runs the prerequisites for installing a new domain in Active Directory.|
|Test-ADDSDomainControllerInstallation|Runs the prerequisites for installing a domain controller in Active Directory.|
|Test-ADDSReadOnlyDomainControllerAccountCreation|Runs the prerequisites for adding a read-only domain controller (RODC) account.|

### <a name="BKMK_PSForest"></a>Installing a new forest root domain using Windows PowerShell
The command syntax for installing a new forest is as follows. Optional arguments appear within square brackets.

```
Install-ADDSForest [-SkipPreChecks] -DomainName <string> -SafeModeAdministratorPassword <SecureString> [-CreateDNSDelegation] [-DatabasePath <string>] [-DNSDelegationCredential <PS Credential>] [-NoDNSOnNetwork] [-DomainMode <DomainMode> {Win2003 | Win2008 | Win2008R2 | Win2012}] [-DomainNetBIOSName <string>] [-ForestMode <ForestMode> {Win2003 | Win2008 | Win2008R2 | Win2012}] [-InstallDNS] [-LogPath <string>] [-NoRebootOnCompletion] [-SkipAutoConfigureDNS] [-SYSVOLPath] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

> [!NOTE]
> The -DomainNetBIOSName argument is required if you want to change the 15-character name that is automatically generated based on the DNS domain name prefix or if the name exceeds 15 characters.

For example, to install a new forest named corp.contoso.com and be securely prompted to provide the DSRM password, type:

```
Install-ADDSForest -DomainName "corp.contoso.com"
```

> [!NOTE]
> DNS server is installed by default when you run Install-ADDSForest.

To install a new forest named corp.contoso.com, create a DNS delegation in the contoso.com domain, set domain functional level to Windows Server 2008 R2 and set forest functional level to Windows Server 2008, install the Active Directory database and SYSVOL on the D:\ drive, install the log files on the E:\ drive, and be prompted to provide the Directory Services Restore Mode password and type:

```
Install-ADDSForest -DomainName corp.contoso.com -CreateDNSDelegation -DomainMode Win2008 -ForestMode Win2008R2 -DatabasePath "d:\NTDS" -SYSVOLPath "d:\SYSVOL" -LogPath "e:\Logs"
```

### <a name="BKMK_PSDomain"></a>Installing a new child or tree domain using Windows PowerShell
The command syntax for installing a new domain is as follows. Optional arguments appear within square brackets.

```
Install-ADDSDomain [-SkipPreChecks] -NewDomainName <string> -ParentDomainName <string> -SafeModeAdministratorPassword <SecureString> [-ADPrepCredential <PS Credential>] [-AllowDomainReinstall] [-CreateDNSDelegation] [-Credential <PS Credential>] [-DatabasePath <string>] [-DNSDelegationCredential <PS Credential>] [-NoDNSOnNetwork] [-DomainMode <DomainMode> {Win2003 | Win2008 | Win2008R2 | Win2012}] [DomainType <DomainType> {Child Domain | TreeDomain} [-InstallDNS] [-LogPath <string>] [-NoGlobalCatalog] [-NewDomainNetBIOSName <string>] [-NoRebootOnCompletion] [-ReplicationSourceDC <string>] [-SiteName <string>] [-SkipAutoConfigureDNS] [-Systemkey <SecureString>] [-SYSVOLPath] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

> [!NOTE]
> The **-credential** argument is only required when you are not currently logged on as a member of the Enterprise Admins group.
>
> The **-NewDomainNetBIOSName** argument is required if you want to change the automatically generated 15-character name based on the DNS domain name prefix or if the name exceeds 15 characters.

For example, to use credentials of corp\EnterpriseAdmin1 to create a new child domain named child.corp.contoso.com, install DNS server, create a DNS delegation in the corp.contoso.com domain, set domain functional level to Windows Server 2003, make the domain controller a global catalog server in a site named Houston, use DC1.corp.contoso.com as the replication source domain controller, install the Active Directory database and SYSVOL on the D:\ drive, install the log files on the E:\ drive, and be prompted to provide the Directory Services Restore Mode password but not prompted to confirm the command, type:

```
Install-ADDSDomain -SafeModeAdministratorPassword -Credential (get-credential corp\EnterpriseAdmin1) -NewDomainName child -ParentDomainName corp.contoso.com -InstallDNS -CreateDNSDelegation -DomainMode Win2003 -ReplicationSourceDC DC1.corp.contoso.com -SiteName Houston -DatabasePath "d:\NTDS" "SYSVOLPath "d:\SYSVOL" -LogPath "e:\Logs" -Confirm:$False
```

### <a name="BKMK_PSReplica"></a>Installing an additional (replica) domain controller using Windows PowerShell
The command syntax for installing an additional domain controller is as follows. Optional arguments appear within square brackets.

```
Install-ADDSDomainController -DomainName <string> [-SkipPreChecks] -SafeModeAdministratorPassword <SecureString> [-ADPrepCredential <PS Credential>] [-AllowDomainControllerReinstall] [-ApplicationPartitionsToReplicate <string[]>] [-CreateDNSDelegation] [-Credential <PS Credential>] [-CriticalReplicationOnly] [-DatabasePath <string>] [-DNSDelegationCredential <PS Credential>] [-NoDNSOnNetwork] [-NoGlobalCatalog] [-InstallationMediaPath <string>] [-InstallDNS] [-LogPath <string>] [-MoveInfrastructureOperationMasterRoleIfNecessary] [-NoRebootOnCompletion] [-ReplicationSourceDC <string>] [-SiteName <string>] [-SkipAutoConfigureDNS] [-SystemKey <SecureString>] [-SYSVOLPath <string>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

To install a domain controller and DNS server in the corp.contoso.com domain and be prompted to supply the domain Administrator credentials and the DSRM password, type:

```
Install-ADDSDomainController -Credential (Get-Credential CORP\Administrator) -DomainName "corp.contoso.com"
```

If the computer is already domain joined and you are a member of the Domain Admins group, you can use:

```
Install-ADDSDomainController -DomainName "corp.contoso.com"
```

To be prompted for the domain name, type:

```
Install-ADDSDomainController -Credential (Get-Credential) -DomainName (Read-Host "Domain to promote into")
```

The following command will use credentials of Contoso\EnterpriseAdmin1 to install a writable domain controller and a global catalog server in a site named Boston, install DNS server, create a DNS delegation in the contoso.com domain, install from media that is stored in the c:\ADDS IFM folder, install the Active Directory database and SYSVOL on the D:\ drive, install the log files on the E:\ drive, have the server automatically restart after AD DS installation is complete, and be prompted to provide the Directory Services Restore Mode password:

```
Install-ADDSDomainController -Credential (Get-Credential CONTOSO\EnterpriseAdmin1) -CreateDNSDelegation -DomainName corp.contoso.com -SiteName Boston -InstallationMediaPath "c:\ADDS IFM" -DatabasePath "d:\NTDS" -SYSVOLPath "d:\SYSVOL" -LogPath "e:\Logs"
```

### Performing a staged RODC installation using Windows PowerShell
The command syntax to create an RODC account is as follows. Optional arguments appear within square brackets.

```
Add-ADDSReadOnlyDomainControllerAccount [-SkipPreChecks] -DomainControllerAccuntName <string> -DomainName <string> -SiteName <string> [-AllowPasswordReplicationAccountName <string []>] [-NoGlobalCatalog] [-Credential <PS Credential>] [-DelegatedAdministratorAccountName <string>] [-DenyPasswordReplicationAccountName <string []>] [-InstallDNS] [-ReplicationSourceDC <string>] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<Common Parameters>]
```

The command syntax to attach a server to an RODC account is as follows. Optional arguments appear within square brackets.

```
Install-ADDSDomainController -DomainName <string> [-SkipPreChecks] -SafeModeAdministratorPassword <SecureString> [-ADPrepCredential <PS Credential>] [-ApplicationPartitionsToReplicate <string[]>] [-Credential <PS Credential>] [-CriticalReplicationOnly] [-DatabasePath <string>] [-NoDNSOnNetwork] [-InstallationMediaPath <string>] [-InstallDNS] [-LogPath <string>] [-MoveInfrastructureOperationMasterRoleIfNecessary] [-NoRebootOnCompletion] [-ReplicationSourceDC <string>] [-SkipAutoConfigureDNS] [-SystemKey <SecureString>] [-SYSVOLPath <string>] [-UseExistingAccount] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

For example, to create an RODC account named RODC1:

```
Add-ADDSReadOnlyDomainControllerAccount -DomainControllerAccountName RODC1 -DomainName corp.contoso.com -SiteName Boston DelegatedAdministratoraccountName PilarA
```

Then run the following commands on the server that you want to attach to the RODC1 account. The server cannot be joined to the domain. First, install the AD DS server role and management tools:

```
Install-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools
```

The run the following command to create the RODC:

```
Install-ADDSDomainController -DomainName corp.contoso.com -SafeModeAdministratorPassword (Read-Host -Prompt "DSRM Password:" -AsSecureString) -Credential (Get-Credential Corp\PilarA) -UseExistingAccount
```

Press **Y** to confirm or include the **"confirm** argument to prevent the confirmation prompt.

## <a name="BKMK_GUI"></a>Installing AD DS by using Server Manager
AD DS can be installed in  Windows Server 2012  by using the Add Roles Wizard in Server Manager, followed by the Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard, which is new beginning in  Windows Server 2012 . The Active Directory Domain Services Installation Wizard (dcpromo.exe) is deprecated beginning in  Windows Server 2012 .

The following sections explain how to create server pools in order to install and manage AD DS on multiple servers, and how to use the wizards to install AD DS.

### <a name="BKMK_ServerPools"></a>Creating server pools
Server Manager can pool other servers on the network as long as they are accessible from the computer running Server Manager. Once pooled, you choose those servers for remote installation of AD DS or any other configuration options possible within Server Manager. The computer running Server Manager automatically pools itself. For more information about server pools, see [Add Servers to Server Manager](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831453(v=ws.11)).

> [!NOTE]
> In order to manage a domain-joined computer using Server Manager on a workgroup server, or vice-versa, additional configuration steps are needed. For more information, see "Add and manage servers in workgroups" in [Add Servers to Server Manager](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831453(v=ws.11)).

### <a name="BKMK_installADDSGUI"></a>Installing AD DS
**Administrative credentials**

The credential requirements to install AD DS vary depending on which deployment configuration you choose. For more information, see [Credential requirements to run Adprep.exe and install Active Directory Domain Services](../../ad-ds/deploy/../../ad-ds/deploy/../../ad-ds/deploy/../../ad-ds/deploy/../../ad-ds/deploy/../../ad-ds/deploy/../../ad-ds/deploy/../../ad-ds/deploy/../../ad-ds/deploy/../../ad-ds/deploy/../../ad-ds/deploy/../../ad-ds/deploy/Install-Active-Directory-Domain-Services--Level-100-.md#BKMK_Creds).

Use the following procedures to install AD DS using the GUI method. The steps can be performed locally or remotely. For more detailed explanation of these steps, see the following topics:

    -   If you are adding a domain controller to an existing domain, select the domain controller that you want to replicate the AD DS installation data from (or allow the wizard to select any domain controller). If you are installing from media, click **Install from media path** type and verify the path to the installation source files, and then click **Next**.

        You cannot use install from media (IFM) to install the first domain controller in a domain. IFM does not work across different operating system versions. In other words, in order to install an additional domain controller that runs  Windows Server 2012  by using IFM, you must create the backup media on a  Windows Server 2012  domain controller. For more information about IFM, see [Installing an Additional Domain Controller by Using IFM](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc816722(v=ws.10)).

## <a name="BKMK_UIStaged"></a>Performing a Staged RODC Installation using the Graphical User Interface
A staged RODC installation allows you to create an RODC in two stages. In the first stage, a member of the Domain Admins group creates an RODC account. In the second stage, a server is attached to the RODC account. The second stage can be completed by a member of the Domain Admins group or a delegated domain user or group.

#### To create an RODC account by using the Active Directory management tools

1.  You can create the RODC account using Active Directory Administrative Center or Active Directory Users and Computers.

    1.  Click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Active Directory Administrative Center**.

    2.  In the navigation pane (left pane), click the name of the domain.

    3.  In the Management list (center pane), click the **Domain Controllers** OU.

    4.  In the Tasks Pane (right pane), click **Pre-create a read-only domain controller account**.

    -Or-

    1.  Click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    2.  Either right-click the **Domain Controllers** organizational unit (OU) or click the **Domain Controllers** OU, and then click **Action**.

    3.  Click **Pre-create Read-only Domain Controller account**.

2.  On the **Welcome to the Active Directory Domain Services Installation Wizard** page, if you want to modify the default the Password Replication Policy (PRP), select **Use advanced mode installation**, and then click **Next**.

3.  On the **Network Credentials** page, under **Specify the account credentials to use to perform the installation**, click **My current logged on credentials** or click **Alternate credentials**, and then click **Set**. In the **Windows Security** dialog box, provide the user name and password for an account that can install the additional domain controller. To install an additional domain controller, you must be a member of the Enterprise Admins group or the Domain Admins group. When you are finished providing credentials, click **Next**.

4.  On the **Specify the Computer Name** page, type the computer name of the server that will be the RODC.

5.  On the **Select a Site** page, select a site from the list or select the option to install the domain controller in the site that corresponds to the IP address of the computer on which you are running the wizard, and then click **Next**.

6.  On the **Additional Domain Controller Options** page, make the following selections, and then click **Next**:

    -   **DNS server**: This option is selected by default so that your domain controller can function as a Domain Name System (DNS) server. If you do not want the domain controller to be a DNS server, clear this option. However, if you do not install the DNS server role on the RODC and the RODC is the only domain controller in the branch office, users in the branch office will not be able to perform name resolution when the wide area network (WAN) to the hub site is offline.

    -   **Global catalog**: This option is selected by default. It adds the global catalog, read-only directory partitions to the domain controller, and it enables global catalog search functionality. If you do not want the domain controller to be a global catalog server, clear this option. However, if you do not install a global catalog server in the branch office or enable universal group membership caching for the site that includes the RODC, users in the branch office will not be able to log on to the domain when the WAN to the hub site is offline.

    -   **Read-only domain controller**. When you create an RODC account, this option is selected by default and you cannot clear it.

7.  If you selected the **Use advanced mode installation** check box on the **Welcome** page, the **Specify the Password Replication Policy** page appears. By default, no account passwords are replicated to the RODC, and security-sensitive accounts (such as members of the Domain Admins group) are explicitly denied from ever having their passwords replicated to the RODC.

    To add other accounts to policy, click **Add**, then click **Allow passwords for the account to replicate to this RODC** or click **Deny passwords for the account from replicating to this RODC** and then select the accounts.

    When complete (or to accept the default setting), click **Next**.

8.  On the **Delegation of RODC Installation and Administration** page, type the name of the user or the group who will attach the server to the RODC account that you are creating. You can type the name of only one security principal.

    To search the directory for a specific user or group, click **Set**. In **Select User or Group**, type the name of the user or group. We recommend that you delegate RODC installation and administration to a group.

    This user or group will also have local administrative rights on the RODC after the installation. If you do not specify a user or group, only members of the Domain Admins group or the Enterprise Admins group will be able to attach the server to the account.

    When you are finished, click **Next**.

9. On the **Summary** page, review your selections. Click **Back** to change any selections, if necessary.

    To save the settings that you selected to an answer file that you can use to automate subsequent AD DS operations, click **Export settings**. Type a name for your answer file, and then click **Save**.

    When you are sure that your selections are accurate, click **Next** to create the RODC account.

10. On the **Completing the Active Directory Domain Services Installation Wizard** page, click **Finish**.

After an RODC account is created, you can attach a server to account to complete the RODC installation. This second stage can be completed in the branch office where the RODC will be located. The server where you perform this procedure must not be joined to the domain. Beginning in  Windows Server 2012 , you use the Add Roles Wizard in Server Manager to attach a server to an RODC account.

#### To attach a server to an RODC account using Server Manager

1.  Log on as local Administrator.

2.  In Server Manager, click **Add roles and features**.

3.  On the **Before you begin** page, click **Next**.

4.  On the **Select installation type** page, click **Role-based or feature-based installation** and then click **Next**.

5.  On the **Select destination server** page, click **Select a server from the server pool**, click the name of the server where you want to install AD DS and then click **Next**.

6.  On the **Select server roles** page, click **Active Directory Domain Services**, click **Add Features** and then click **Next**.

7.  On the **Select features** page, select any additional features that you want to install and click **Next**.

8.  On the **Active Directory Domain Services** page, review the information and then click **Next**.

9. On the **Confirm installation selections** page, click **Install**.

10. On the **Results** page, verify **Installation succeeded**, and click **Promote this server to a domain controller** to start the Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you close Add Roles Wizard at this point without starting the Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard, you can restart it by clicking Tasks in Server Manager.
