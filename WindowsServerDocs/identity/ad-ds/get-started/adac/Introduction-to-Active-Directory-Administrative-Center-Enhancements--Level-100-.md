# Introduction to Active Directory Administrative Center Enhancements (Level 100)

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

The Active Directory Administrative Center in Windows Server includes management features for the following:

- [Active Directory Recycle Bin](../../../ad-ds/get-started/adac/Introduction-to-Active-Directory-Administrative-Center-Enhancements--Level-100-.md#ad_recycle_bin_mgmt)
- [Fine-Grained Password Policy](../../../ad-ds/get-started/adac/Introduction-to-Active-Directory-Administrative-Center-Enhancements--Level-100-.md#fine_grained_pswd_policy_mgmt)
- [Windows PowerShell History Viewer](../../../ad-ds/get-started/adac/Introduction-to-Active-Directory-Administrative-Center-Enhancements--Level-100-.md#windows_powershell_history_viewer)

## <a name="ad_recycle_bin_mgmt"></a>Active Directory Recycle Bin

Accidental deletion of Active Directory objects is a common occurrence for users of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS). In past versions of Windows Server, prior to  Windows Server 2008 R2 , one could recover accidentally deleted objects in Active Directory, but the solutions had their drawbacks.

In Windows Server 2008, you could use the Windows Server Backup feature and **ntdsutil** authoritative restore command to mark objects as authoritative to ensure that the restored data was replicated throughout the domain. The drawback to the authoritative restore solution was that it had to be performed in Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM). During DSRM, the domain controller being restored had to remain offline. Therefore, it was not able to service client requests.

In Windows Server 2003 Active Directory and Windows Server 2008 AD DS, you could recover deleted Active Directory objects through tombstone reanimation. However, reanimated objects' link-valued attributes (for example, group memberships of user accounts) that were physically removed and non-link-valued attributes that were cleared were not recovered. Therefore, administrators could not rely on tombstone reanimation as the ultimate solution to accidental deletion of objects. For more information about tombstone reanimation, see [Reanimating Active Directory Tombstone Objects](/previous-versions/technet-magazine/cc137800(v=msdn.10)).

Active Directory Recycle Bin, starting in Windows Server 2008 R2, builds on the existing tombstone reanimation infrastructure and enhances your ability to preserve and recover accidentally deleted Active Directory objects.

When you enable Active Directory Recycle Bin, all link-valued and non-link-valued attributes of the deleted Active Directory objects are preserved and the objects are restored in their entirety to the same consistent logical state that they were in immediately before deletion. For example, restored user accounts automatically regain all group memberships and corresponding access rights that they had immediately before deletion, within and across domains. Active Directory Recycle Bin works for both AD DS and AD LDS environments. For a detailed description of Active Directory Recycle Bin, see [What's New in AD DS: Active Directory Recycle Bin](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd391916(v=ws.10)).

**What's new?** In Windows Server 2012 and newer, the Active Directory Recycle Bin feature is enhanced with a new graphical user interface for users to manage and restore deleted objects. Users can now visually locate a list of deleted objects and restore them to their original or desired locations.

If you plan to enable Active Directory Recycle Bin in Windows Server, consider the following:

- By default, Active Directory Recycle Bin is disabled. To enable it, you must first raise the forest functional level of your AD DS or AD LDS environment to Windows Server 2008 R2 or higher. This in turn requires that all domain controllers in the forest or all servers that host instances of AD LDS configuration sets be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or higher.
- The process of enabling Active Directory Recycle Bin is irreversible. After you enable Active Directory Recycle Bin in your environment, you cannot disable it.
- To manage the Recycle Bin feature through a user interface, you must install the version of Active Directory Administrative Center in Windows Server 2012.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use **Server Manager** to install Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) to use the correct version of Active Directory Administrative Center to manage Recycle Bin through a user interface.
    >
    > For information about installing RSAT, see the article [Remote Server Administration Tools](../../../../remote/remote-server-administration-tools.md).

### Active Directory Recycle Bin step-by-step

In the following steps, you will use ADAC to perform the following Active Directory Recycle Bin tasks in  Windows Server 2012 :

- [Step 1: Raise the forest functional level](../../../ad-ds/get-started/adac/Introduction-to-Active-Directory-Administrative-Center-Enhancements--Level-100-.md#bkmk_raise_ffl)
- [Step 2: Enable Recycle Bin](../../../ad-ds/get-started/adac/Introduction-to-Active-Directory-Administrative-Center-Enhancements--Level-100-.md#bkmk_enable_recycle_bin)
- [Step 3: Create test users, group and organizational unit](../../../ad-ds/get-started/adac/Introduction-to-Active-Directory-Administrative-Center-Enhancements--Level-100-.md#bkmk_create_test_env)

## <a name="fine_grained_pswd_policy_mgmt"></a>Fine-Grained Password Policy

The Windows Server 2008 operating system provides organizations with a way to define different password and account lockout policies for different sets of users in a domain. In Active Directory domains prior to Windows Server 2008, only one password policy and account lockout policy could be applied to all users in the domain. These policies were specified in the Default Domain Policy for the domain. As a result, organizations that wanted different password and account lockout settings for different sets of users had to either create a password filter or deploy multiple domains. Both are costly options.

You can use fine-grained password policies to specify multiple password policies within a single domain and apply different restrictions for password and account lockout policies to different sets of users in a domain. For example, you can apply stricter settings to privileged accounts and less strict settings to the accounts of other users. In other cases, you might want to apply a special password policy for accounts whose passwords are synchronized with other data sources. For a detailed description of Fine-Grained Password Policy, see [AD DS: Fine-Grained Password Policies](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc770394(v=ws.10))

**What's new?**

In Windows Server 2012 and newer, fine-grained password policy management is made easier and more visual by providing a user interface for AD DS administrators to manage them in ADAC. Administrators can now view a given user's resultant policy, view and sort all password policies within a given domain, and manage individual password policies visually.

If you plan to use fine-grained password policies in Windows Server 2012, consider the following:

- Fine-grained password policies apply only to global security groups and user objects (or inetOrgPerson objects if they are used instead of user objects). By default, only members of the Domain Admins group can set fine-grained password policies. However, you can also delegate the ability to set these policies to other users. The domain functional level must be Windows Server 2008 or higher.

- You must use the Windows Server 2012 or newer version of Active Directory Administrative Center to administer fine-grained password policies through a graphical user interface.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use **Server Manager** to install Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) to use the correct version of Active Directory Administrative Center to manage Recycle Bin through a user interface.
    >
    > For information about installing RSAT, see the article [Remote Server Administration Tools](../../../../remote/remote-server-administration-tools.md).

## <a name="windows_powershell_history_viewer"></a>Windows PowerShell History Viewer

ADAC is a user interface tool built on top of Windows PowerShell. In Windows Server 2012 and newer, IT administrators can leverage ADAC to learn Windows PowerShell for Active Directory cmdlets by using the Windows PowerShell History Viewer. As actions are executed in the user interface, the equivalent Windows PowerShell command is shown to the user in Windows PowerShell History Viewer. This allows administrators to create automated scripts and reduce repetitive tasks, thus increasing IT productivity. Also, this feature reduces the time to learn Windows PowerShell for Active Directory and increases the users' confidence in the correctness of their automation scripts.

When using the Windows PowerShell History Viewer in Windows Server 2012 or newer consider the following:

- To use Windows PowerShell Script Viewer, you must use the Windows Server 2012 or newer version of ADAC

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use **Server Manager** to install Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) to use the correct version of Active Directory Administrative Center to manage Recycle Bin through a user interface.
    >
    > For information about installing RSAT, see the article [Remote Server Administration Tools](../../../../remote/remote-server-administration-tools.md).

- Have a basic understanding of Windows PowerShell. For example, you need to know how piping in Windows PowerShell works. For more information about piping in Windows PowerShell, see [Piping and the Pipeline in Windows PowerShell](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-powershell-1.0/ee176927(v=technet.10)).

### Windows PowerShell History Viewer step-by-step

In the following procedure, you will use the Windows PowerShell History Viewer in ADAC to construct a Windows PowerShell script.  Before you begin this procedure, remove user, **test1** from the group, **group1**.
