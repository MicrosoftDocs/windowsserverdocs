## <a name="BKMK_1"></a>Step 1: Configure access-denied assistance
You can configure access-denied assistance within a domain by using Group Policy, or you can configure the assistance individually on each file server by using the File Server Resource Manager console. You can also change the access-denied message for a specific shared folder on a file server.

You can configure access-denied assistance for the domain by using Group Policy as follows:

#### To configure access-denied assistance by using Group Policy

1.  Open Group Policy Management. In Server Manager, click **Tools**, and then click **Group Policy Management**.

2.  Right-click the appropriate Group Policy, and then click **Edit**.

3.  Click **Computer Configuration**, click **Policies**, click **Administrative Templates**, click **System**, and then click **Access-Denied Assistance**.

4.  Right-click **Customize message for Access Denied errors**, and then click **Edit**.

5.  Select the **Enabled** option.

6.  Configure the following options:

    1.  In the **Display the following message to users who are denied access** box, type a message that users will see when they are denied access to a file or folder.

        You can add macros to the message that will insert customized text. The macros include:

        -   **[Original File Path]** The original file path that was accessed by the user.

        -   **[Original File Path Folder]** The parent folder of the original file path that was accessed by the user.

        -   **[Admin Email]** The administrator email recipient list.

        -   **[Data Owner Email]** The data owner email recipient list.

    2.  Select the **Enable users to request assistance** check box.

    3.  Leave the remaining default settings.

The following Windows PowerShell cmdlet or cmdlets perform the same function as the preceding procedure. Enter each cmdlet on a single line, even though they may appear word-wrapped across several lines here because of formatting constraints.

```
Set-GPRegistryValue -Name "Name of GPO" -key "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\ADR\AccessDenied" -ValueName AllowEmailRequests -Type DWORD -value 1
Set-GPRegistryValue -Name "Name of GPO" -key "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\ADR\AccessDenied" -ValueName GenerateLog -Type DWORD -value 1

```

Alternatively, you can configure access-denied assistance individually on each file server by using the File Server Resource Manager console.

```

## <a name="BKMK_2"></a>Step 2: Configure the email notification settings
You must configure the email notification settings on each file server that will send the access-denied assistance messages.

[Do this step using Windows PowerShell](assetId:///4a96cdaf-0081-4824-aab8-f0d51be501ac#BKMK_PSstep2)

    -   In the **SMTP server name or IP address** box, type the name of IP address of the SMTP server in your organization.

    -   In the **Default administrator recipients** and **Default 'From' e-mail address** boxes, type the email address of the file server administrator.

5.  Click **Send Test E-mail** to ensure that the email notifications are configured correctly.

6.  Click **OK**.

The following Windows PowerShell cmdlet or cmdlets perform the same function as the preceding procedure. Enter each cmdlet on a single line, even though they may appear word-wrapped across several lines here because of formatting constraints.

```
set-FSRMSetting -SMTPServer "server1" -AdminEmailAddress "fileadmin@contoso.com" -FromEmailAddress "fileadmin@contoso.com"
```

## <a name="BKMK_3"></a>Step 3: Verify that access-denied assistance is configured correctly
You can verify that the access-denied assistance is configured correctly by having a user who is running Windows 8 try to access a share or a file in that share that they do not have access to. When the access-denied message appears, the user should see a **Request Assistance** button. After clicking the Request Assistance button, the user can specify a reason for access and then send an email to the folder owner or file server administrator. The folder owner or file server administrator can verify for you that the email arrived and contains the appropriate details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to verify access-denied assistance by having a user who is running  Windows Server 2012 , you must install the Desktop Experience before connecting to the file share.
