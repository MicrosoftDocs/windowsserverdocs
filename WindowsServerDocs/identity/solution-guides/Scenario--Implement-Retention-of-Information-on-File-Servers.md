# Scenario: Implement Retention of Information on File Servers

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

A retention period is the amount of time that a document should be kept before it is expired. Depending on the organization, the retention period can be different. You can classify files in a folder as having a short, medium, or long-term retention period, and then assign a timeframe for each period. You may want to keep a file indefinitely by putting it on legal hold.

## <a name="BKMK_OVER"></a>Scenario description
File Classification Infrastructure and File Server Resource Manager uses file management tasks and file classification to apply retention periods for a set of files. You can assign a retention period on a folder and then use a file management task to configure how long an assigned retention period is to last. When the files in the folder are about to expire, the owner of the file receives a notification email. You can also classify a file as being on legal hold so that the file management task will not expire the file.

You can find planning information for configuring retention in [Plan for Retention of Information on File Servers](assetId:///edf13190-7077-455a-ac01-f534064a9e0c).

You can find steps for classifying files for legal hold and configuring a retention period in [Deploy Implementing Retention of Information on File Servers &#40;Demonstration Steps&#41;](Deploy-Implementing-Retention-of-Information-on-File-Servers--Demonstration-Steps-.md).

> [!NOTE]
> That scenario only discusses how to manually classify a document for legal hold. However, it is possible in  Windows Server 2012  to automatically classify documents for legal hold. One way to do this is to create a Windows PowerShell classifier that compares the file owner to a list of user accounts that are under legal hold. If the file owner is a part of the user account list, the file is classified for legal hold.
