# Appendix B: Setting Up the Test Environment

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

This topic outlines the steps to build a hands-on lab to test Dynamic Access Control. The instructions are meant to be followed sequentially because there are many components that have dependencies.

## Prerequisites
**Hardware and software requirements**

Requirements for setting up the test lab:

-   A host server running Windows Server 2008 R2 with SP1 and Hyper-V

-   A copy of the  Windows Server 2012  ISO

-   A copy of the Windows 8 ISO

-   Microsoft Office 2010

-   A server running Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 or later

You need to build the following virtual machines to test the Dynamic Access Control scenarios:

-   DC1 (domain controller)

-   DC2 (domain controller)

-   FILE1 (file server and Active Directory Rights Management Services)

-   SRV1 (POP3 and SMTP server)

-   CLIENT1 (client computer with Microsoft Outlook)

The passwords for the virtual machines should be as follows:

-   BUILTIN\Administrator: pass@word1

-   Contoso\Administrator: pass@word1

-   All other accounts: pass@word1

## Build the test lab virtual machines

#### Create groups on FILE1

###### To create security groups on FILE1

1. Sign in to FILE1 as contoso\administrator, with the password: <strong>pass@word1</strong>.

2. Add NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users to the **WinRMRemoteWMIUsers__** group.

#### Create files and folders on FILE1

1.  Create a new NTFS volume on FILE1 and then create the following folder: D:\Finance Documents.

2.  Create the following files with the details specified:

    -   **Finance Memo.docx**: Add some finance related text in the document. For example, 'The business rules about who can access finance documents have changed. Finance documents are now only accessed by members of the FinanceExpert group. No other departments or groups have access.' You need to evaluate the impact of this change before implementing it in the environment. Ensure that this document has CONTOSO CONFIDENTIAL as the footer on every page.

    -   **Request for Approval to Hire.docx**: Create a form in this document that collects applicant information. You must have the following fields in the document: **Applicant Name, Social Security number, Job Title, Proposed Salary, Starting Date, Supervisor name, Department**. Add an additional section in the document that has a form for **Supervisor Signature, Approved Salary, Conformation of Offer**, and **Status of Offer**.
        Make the document rights-management enabled.

    -   **Word Document1.docx**: Add some test content to this document.

    -   **Word Document2.docx**: Add test content to this document.

    -   **Workbook1.xlsx**

    -   **Workbook2.xlsx**

    -   Create a folder on the desktop called Regular Expressions. Create a text document under the folder called **RegEx-SSN**. Type the following content in the file, and then save and close the file:
        ^(?!000)([0-7]\d{2}|7([0-7]\d|7[012]))([ -]?)(?!00)\d\d\3(?!0000)\d{4}$

3.  Share the folder D:\Finance Documents as Finance Documents and allow everyone to have Read and Write access to the share.

Optionally, instead of using the Add Roles and Features Wizard in Server Manager, you can use Windows PowerShell to install and configure the AD RMS server role as show in the following procedure.

###### To install and configure an AD RMS cluster in Windows Server 2012 using Windows PowerShell

1. Logon on as CONTOSO\Administrator with the password: <strong>pass@word1</strong>.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > In order to install the AD RMS server role the installer account (in this case, CONTOSO\Administrator) will have to be given membership in both the local Administrators group on the server computer where AD RMS is to be installed as well as membership in the Enterprise Admins group in Active Directory.

2. On the Server desktop, right-click the Windows PowerShell icon on the taskbar and select **Run as Administrator** to open a Windows PowerShell prompt with administrative privileges.

3. To use Server Manager cmdlets to install the AD RMS server role, type:

   ```
   Add-WindowsFeature ADRMS '"IncludeAllSubFeature '"IncludeManagementTools
   ```

4. Create the Windows PowerShell drive to represent the AD RMS server you are installing.

   For example, to create a Windows PowerShell drive named RC to install and configure the first server in an AD RMS root cluster, type:

   ```
   Import-Module ADRMS
   New-PSDrive -PSProvider ADRMSInstall -Name RC -Root RootCluster
   ```

5. Set properties on objects in the drive namespace that represent required configuration settings.

   For example, to set the AD RMS service account, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, type:

   ```
   $svcacct = Get-Credential
   ```

   When the Windows security dialog box appears, type the AD RMS service account domain user name CONTOSO\RMS and the assigned password.

   Next, to assign the AD RMS service account to the AD RMS cluster settings, type the following:

   ```
   Set-ItemProperty -Path RC:\ -Name ServiceAccount -Value $svcacct
   ```

   Next, to set the AD RMS server to use the Windows Internal Database, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, type:

   ```
   Set-ItemProperty -Path RC:\ClusterDatabase -Name UseWindowsInternalDatabase -Value $true
   ```

   Next, to securely store the cluster key password in a variable, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, type:

   ```
   $password = Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt "Password:"
   ```

   Type the cluster key password, and then press the ENTER key.

   Next, to assign the password to your AD RMS installation, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, type:

   ```
   Set-ItemProperty -Path RC:\ClusterKey -Name CentrallyManagedPassword -Value $password
   ```

   Next, to set the AD RMS cluster address, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, type:

   ```
   Set-ItemProperty -Path RC:\ -Name ClusterURL -Value "http://file1.contoso.com:80"
   ```

   Next, to assign the SLC name for your AD RMS installation, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, type:

   ```
   Set-ItemProperty -Path RC:\ -Name SLCName -Value "FILE1"
   ```

   Next, to set the service connection point (SCP) for the AD RMS cluster, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, type:

   ```
   Set-ItemProperty -Path RC:\ -Name RegisterSCP -Value $true
   ```

6. Run the **Install-ADRMS** cmdlet. In addition to installing the AD RMS server role and configuring the server, this cmdlet also installs other features required by AD RMS if necessary.

   For example, to change to the Windows PowerShell drive named RC and install and configure AD RMS, type:

   ```
   Set-Location RC:\
   Install-ADRMS -Path.
   ```

   Type "Y" when the cmdlet prompts you to confirm you want to start the installation.

7. Log out as CONTOSO\Administrator and log on as CONTOSO\RMS using the provided password ("pass@word1").

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > In order to manage the AD RMS server the account you are logged on to and using to manage the server (in this case, CONTOSO\RMS) will have to be given membership in both the local Administrators group on the AD RMS server computer as well as membership in the Enterprise Admins group in Active Directory.

8. On the Server desktop, right-click the Windows PowerShell icon on the taskbar and select **Run as Administrator** to open a Windows PowerShell prompt with administrative privileges.

9. Create the Windows PowerShell drive to represent the AD RMS server you are configuring.

    For example, to create a Windows PowerShell drive named RC to configure the AD RMS root cluster, type:

    ```
    Import-Module ADRMSAdmin `
    New-PSDrive -PSProvider ADRMSAdmin -Name RC -Root http://localhost -Force -Scope Global
    ```

10. To create new rights template for the Contoso finance administrator and assign it user rights with full control in your AD RMS installation, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, type:

    ```
    New-Item -Path RC:\RightsPolicyTemplate '"LocaleName en-us -DisplayName "Contoso Finance Admin Only" -Description "Contoso Finance Admin Only" -UserGroup financeadmin@contoso.com  -Right ('FullControl')
    ```

11. To verify that you can see the new rights template for the Contoso finance administrator, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt:

    ```
    Get-FsrmRmsTemplate
    ```

    Review the output of this cmdlet to confirm the RMS template you created in the previous step is present.
