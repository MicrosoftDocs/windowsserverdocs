| [Secure access to company resources from any location on any device](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn550982.aspx)|This guide shows how to allow employees to use personal and company devices to securely access corporate applications and data.                                                                                                                                                                                    
| [Join to Workplace from Any Device for SSO and Seamless Second Factor Authentication Across Company Applications](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn280945.aspx) | Employees can access applications and data everywhere, on any device. Employees can use Single Sign-On in browser applications or enterprise applications. Administrators can control who has access to company resources that are based on application, user, device, and location.                                        
| [Manage Risk with Additional Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Applications](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn280949.aspx)| In this scenario, you enable MFA based on the user's group membership data for a specific application. In other words, you will set up an authentication policy on your federation server to require MFA when users that belong to a certain group request access to a specific application that is hosted on a web server.  
| [Manage Risk with Conditional Access Control](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn280937.aspx) | Access control in AD FS is implemented with issuance authorization claim rules that are used to issue a permit or deny claims that will determine whether a user or a group of users will be allowed to access AD FS-secured resources or not. Authorization rules can only be set on relying party trusts.
|[Configuring Certificate Enrollment Web Service for certificate key-based renewal on a custom port](certificate-enrollment-certificate-key-based-renewal.md)|This article provides step-by-step instructions to implement the Certificate Enrollment Web Service (or Certificate Enrollment Policy (CEP) / Certificate Enrollment Service (CES)) on a custom port other than 443 for certificate key-based renewal to take advantage of the automatic renewal feature of CEP and CES. |
