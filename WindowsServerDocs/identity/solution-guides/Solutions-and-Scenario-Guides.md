In other words, you will set up an authentication policy on your federation server to require MFA when users that belong to a certain group request access to a specific application that is hosted on a web server.
| [Manage Risk with Conditional Access Control](../ad-fs/operations/manage-risk-with-conditional-access-control.md) | Access control in AD FS is implemented with issuance authorization claim rules that are used to issue a permit or deny claims that will determine whether a user or a group of users will be allowed to access AD FS-secured resources or not. Authorization rules can only be set on relying party trusts.
