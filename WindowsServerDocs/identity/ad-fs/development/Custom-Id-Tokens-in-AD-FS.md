# Customize claims to be emitted in id_token when using OpenID Connect or OAuth with AD FS 2016 or later

## Overview

The article [here](native-client-with-ad-fs.md) shows you how to build an app that uses AD FS for OpenID Connect sign on. However, by default there are only a fixed set of claims available in the id_token. AD FS 2016 and later releases have the capability to customize the id_token in OpenID Connect scenarios.

## When are custom ID tokens used?

In certain scenarios, it is possible that the client application does not have a resource that it is trying to access. Therefore, it doesn't really need an access token. In such cases, the client application essentially needs only an ID token, but with some additional claims to help in the functionality.

## What are the restrictions on getting custom claims in ID token?

### Scenario 1

![Screenshot showing Scenario 1 which is using relying party I D to equal client I D.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/res1.png)

1. `response_mode` is set as `form_post`
2. Only public clients can get custom claims in ID token
3. Relying party identifier (Web API identifier) should be the same as the client identifier

### Scenario 2

![Screenshot showing Scenario 2 which is using allatclaims scope.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/restrict2.png)

With [KB4019472](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4019472/windows-10-update-kb4019472) or later security update installed on your AD FS servers
1. `response_mode` is set as form_post
2. Both public and confidential clients can get custom claims in ID token
3. Assign scope `allatclaims` to the client â€“ RP pair.

You can assign the scope by using the `Grant-ADFSApplicationPermission` cmdlet as indicated in the example below:

```powershell
Grant-AdfsApplicationPermission -ClientRoleIdentifier "https://my/privateclient" -ServerRoleIdentifier "https://rp/fedpassive" -ScopeNames "allatclaims","openid"
```

## Creating and configuring an OAuth application to handle custom claims in ID token

Follow the steps below to create and configure the application in AD FS for receiving ID token with custom claims.

### Create and configure an Application Group in AD FS 2016 or later

1. In AD FS Management, right-click on Application Groups and select **Add Application Group**.
2. On the Application Group Wizard, for the name enter **ADFSSSO** and under Client-Server applications select the **Native application accessing a web application** template. Click **Next**.

   ![Screenshot of the Welcome page of the Add Application Group Wizard.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/clientsnap1.png)

3. Copy the **Client Identifier** value.  It will be used later as the value for ida:ClientId  in the applications web.config file.
4. Enter the following for **Redirect URI:** - **https://localhost:44320/**.  Click **Add**. Click **Next**.

   ![Screenshot of the Native application page of the Add Application Group Wizard showing the redirect U R I .](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/clientsnap2.png)

5. On the **Configure Web API** screen, enter the following for **Identifier** - **https://contoso.com/WebApp**.  Click **Add**. Click **Next**.  This value will be used later for **ida:ResourceID** in the applications web.config file.

   ![Screenshot of the Configure Web API page of the Add Application Group Wizard showing the correct identifier.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/clientsnap3.png)

6. On the **Choose Access Control Policy** screen, select **Permit everyone** and click **Next**.

   ![Screenshot of the Choose Access Control Policy page of the Add Application Group Wizard showing the Permit everyone option highlighted.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/clientsnap4.png)

7. On the **Configure Application Permissions** screen, make sure **openid** and **allatclaims** are selected and click **Next**.

   ![Screenshot of the Configure Application Permissions page of the Add Application Group Wizard.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/clientsnap5.PNG)

8. On the **Summary** screen, click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the A D F S S O Properties dialog box Showing the Issuance Transform Rules tab.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/clientsnap8.PNG)

12. On **Add Transform Claim Rule Wizard** screen, select **Send Claims Using a Custom Rule** from the drop-down and click **Next**

    ![Screenshot of the Select Rule Template page of the Add Transform Claim Rule Wizard showing the Send Claims Using a Custom Rule option selected.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/clientsnap9.PNG)

13. On the **Add Transform Claim Rule Wizard** screen, enter **ForCustomIDToken** in the **Claim rule name** and the following claim rule in **Custom rule**. Click **Finish**

    ```
    x:[]
    => issue(claim=x);
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the Configure Rule page of the Add Transform Claim Rule Wizard showing the Claim rule name and Custom rule text fields populated.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/clientsnap10.PNG)

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also use PowerShell to assign the `allatclaims` and `openid` scopes.

    ``` powershell
    Grant-AdfsApplicationPermission -ClientRoleIdentifier "[Client ID from #3 above]" -ServerRoleIdentifier "[Identifier from #5 above]" -ScopeNames "allatclaims","openid"
    ```

### Download and modify the sample application to emit custom claims in id_token

This section discusses how to download the sample Web APP and modify it in Visual Studio. We will be using the Azure AD sample located [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/1-WebApp-OIDC).

To download the sample project, use Git Bash and type the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/1-WebApp-OIDC
```

![Screenshot of the Git Bash window showing the results of the git clone command.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/AD_FS_OpenID_1.PNG)

#### To Modify the app

1. Open the sample using Visual Studio.
2. Rebuild the app so that all of the missing NuGet packages are restored.
3. Open the web.config file.  Modify the following values so the look like the following:

   ```xml
   <add key="ida:ClientId" value="[Replace this Client Id from #3 above under section Create and configure an Application Group in AD FS 2016 or later]" />
   <add key="ida:ResourceID" value="[Replace this with the Web API Identifier from #5 above]"  />
   <add key="ida:ADFSDiscoveryDoc" value="https://[Your ADFS hostname]/adfs/.well-known/openid-configuration" />
   <!--<add key="ida:Tenant" value="[Enter tenant name, e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com]" />
   <add key="ida:AADInstance" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}" />-->
   <add key="ida:PostLogoutRedirectUri" value="[Replace this with the Redirect URI from #4 above]" />
   ```

   ![Screenshot of the web config file showing the modified values.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/AD_FS_OpenID_2.png)

4. Open the Startup.Auth.cs file and make the following changes:

   - Tweak the OpenId Connect middleware initialization logic with the following changes:

      ```cs
      private static string clientId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:ClientId"];
      //private static string aadInstance = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:AADInstance"];
      //private static string tenant = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Tenant"];
      private static string metadataAddress = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:ADFSDiscoveryDoc"];
      private static string resourceId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:ResourceID"];
      private static string postLogoutRedirectUri = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:PostLogoutRedirectUri"];
      ```

   - Comment out the following:

      ```cs
      //string Authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, tenant);
      ```

      ![Screenshot of the Start up Auth file showing the commented out lines of code.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/AD_FS_OpenID_3.png)

   - Further down, modify the OpenId Connect middleware options as in the following:

      ```cs
      app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(
          new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
          {
              ClientId = clientId,
              //Authority = authority,
              Resource = resourceId,
              MetadataAddress = metadataAddress,
              PostLogoutRedirectUri = postLogoutRedirectUri,
              RedirectUri = postLogoutRedirectUri
      ```

      ![Screenshot of the Start up Auth file showing the modified Open I D Connect middleware options.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/AD_FS_OpenID_4.png)

5. Open the HomeController.cs file and make the following changes:

   - Add the following:

      ```cs
      using System.Security.Claims;
      ```

   - Update the `About()` method as shown below:

      ```cs
      [Authorize]
      public ActionResult About()
      {
          ClaimsPrincipal cp = ClaimsPrincipal.Current;
          string userName = cp.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.WindowsAccountName).Value;
          ViewBag.Message = String.Format("Hello {0}!", userName);
          return View();
      }
      ```

      ![Screenshot of the Home Controller file with the requred updates.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/AD_FS_OpenID_5.png)

### Test the custom claims in ID token

Once the above changes have been made, hit F5. This will bring up the sample page. Click on sign in.

![Screenshot of the sample app displayed in a browser.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/AD_FS_OpenID_6.PNG)

You will be redirected to the AD FS sign-in page. Go ahead and sign in.

![Screenshot of the A D F S Sign in page.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/AD_FS_OpenID_7.PNG)

Once this is successful, you should see that you are now signed in.

![Screenshot of the sample app showing that the user is signed in.](media/Custom-Id-Tokens-in-AD-FS/AD_FS_OpenID_8.png)

Click the About link. You will see "Hello [Username]" which is retrieved from the username claim in ID token
