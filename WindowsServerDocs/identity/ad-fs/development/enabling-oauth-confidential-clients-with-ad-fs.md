# Build a server-side app that uses OAuth confidential clients by using AD FS 2016 or later


Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2016 and later supports clients that can maintain their own secret, such as an app or service that runs on a web server.  These clients are known as *confidential clients*.

This article describes a web application running on a web server. The application serves as a confidential client to AD FS.

## Prerequisites
You'll need the following resources: 

-   GitHub client tools.

-   AD FS in Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4 or later. (This article assumes that AD FS has been installed.)

-   Visual Studio 2013 or later.

## Create an application group

To create an application group in AD FS 2016 or later:

1.  In AD FS Management, right-click **Application Groups**. Then select **Add Application Group**.

2.  In the **Add Application Group Wizard**: 
    1. Under **Name**, enter *ADFSOAUTHCC*. 
    1. Under **Client-Server applications**, select the **Server application accessing a Web API** template.  
    1. Select **Next**.

## Upgrade the database
This article is based on Visual Studio 2015. To make the example work with Visual Studio 2015, upgrade the database file by following the instructions in this section.

This section discusses how to download the sample web API and upgrade the database in Visual Studio 2015. We use the [Azure Active Directory sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-webapi-oauth2-useridentity).

To download the sample project, in Git Bash, enter the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-webapi-oauth2-useridentity.git
```

## Modify the web API 

To modify the sample web API in Visual Studio:

1.  In Visual Studio, open the sample.

2.  Open the *web.config* file.  Modify the following settings by using the values you copied in the [Create an application group](#create-an-application-group) procedure:

    -   `ida:ClientId`: Enter the client ID.

    -   `ida:ClientSecret`: Enter the client secret.

    -   `ida:GraphResourceId`: Enter the graph resource ID.

    ![Screenshot that highlights the values you should change.](media/Enabling-Oauth-Confidential-Clients-with-AD-FS-2016/AD_FS_Confidential_24.PNG)

3. Under **App_Start**, open the *Startup.Auth.cs* file. Make the following changes:

    -   Comment out the following lines:

        ```
        //private static string aadInstance = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:AADInstance"];
        //private static string tenant = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Tenant"];
        //public static readonly string Authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, tenant);
        ```

    -   In place of the removed lines, add the following line:

        ```
        public static readonly string Authority = "https://<your_fsname>/adfs";
        ```

        Here, replace `<your_fsname>` with the DNS portion of your federation service URL. For example, enter *adfs.contoso.com*.

        ![Screenshot that shows the changes in the Startup dot Auth dot C S file.](media/Enabling-Oauth-Confidential-Clients-with-AD-FS-2016/AD_FS_Confidential_25.PNG)

4.  Open the *UserProfileController.cs* file. Make the following changes:

    -   Comment out the following line:

        ```
        //authContext = new AuthenticationContext(Startup.Authority, new TokenDbCache(userObjectID));
        ```

    -   Replace both occurrences with the following code:

        ```
        authContext = new AuthenticationContext(Startup.Authority, false, new TokenDbCache(userObjectID));
        ```

        ![Screenshot that shows the changes in the User Profile Controller dot C S file.](media/Enabling-Oauth-Confidential-Clients-with-AD-FS-2016/AD_FS_Confidential_27.PNG)

    -   Comment out the following line:

        ```
        //authContext = new AuthenticationContext(Startup.Authority);
        ```

    -   Replace both occurrences with the following code:

        ```
        authContext = new AuthenticationContext(Startup.Authority, false);
        ```

        ![Screenshot that highlights the changes made to the authContext value.](media/Enabling-Oauth-Confidential-Clients-with-AD-FS-2016/AD_FS_Confidential_28.PNG)

    -   Comment out all instances of the following line:

        ```
        Uri redirectUri = new Uri(Request.Url.GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority).ToString() + "/OAuth");
        ```

    -   Replace all occurrences with the following code:

        ```
        Uri redirectUri = new Uri(Request.Url.GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority).ToString());
        ```

        ![Screenshot that highlights the U R I redirect U R I value.](media/Enabling-Oauth-Confidential-Clients-with-AD-FS-2016/AD_FS_Confidential_34.PNG)
