## Implicit grant flow

For single page applications (AngularJS, Ember.js, React.js, and so on), AD FS supports the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant flow. The implicit flow is described in the [OAuth 2.0 Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2). Its primary benefit is that it allows the app to get tokens from AD FS without performing a backend server credential exchange. This allows the app to sign in the user, maintain session, and get tokens to other web APIs all within the client JavaScript code. There are a few important security considerations to take into account when using the implicit flow specifically around [client](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.3).

If you want to use the implicit flow and AD FS to add authentication to your JavaScript app, follow the general steps below.

### Protocol diagram

The following diagram shows what the entire implicit sign-in flow looks like and the sections that follow describe each step in more detail.

![Implicit sign-in](media/adfs-scenarios-for-developers/implicit.png)

### Request ID Token and Access Token

To initially sign the user into your app, you can send an OpenID Connect authentication request and get id_token and access token from the AD FS endpoint.

```
// Line breaks for legibility only

https://adfs.contoso.com/adfs/oauth2/authorize?
client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&response_type=id_token+token
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&scope=openid
&response_mode=fragment
&state=12345
```


|Parameter|Required/Optional|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|client_id|required|The Application (client) ID that the AD FS assigned to your app.|
|response_type|required|Must include `id_token` for OpenID Connect sign-in. It may also include the response_type `token`. Using token here will allow your app to receive an access token immediately from the authorize endpoint without having to make a second request to the token endpoint.|
|redirect_uri|required|The redirect_uri of your app, where authentication responses can be sent and received by your app. It must exactly match one of the redirect_uris you configured in AD FS.|
|nonce|required|A value included in the request, generated by the app, that will be included in the resulting id_token as a claim. The app can then verify this value to mitigate token replay attacks. The value is typically a randomized, unique string that can be used to identify the origin of the request. Only required when an id_token is requested.|
|scope|optional|A space-separated list of scopes. For OpenID Connect, it must include the scope `openid`.|
|resource|optional|The url of your Web API.</br>Note – If using MSAL client library, then resource parameter is not sent. Instead the resource url is sent as a part of the scope parameter: `scope = [resource url]//[scope values e.g., openid]`</br>If resource is not passed here or in scope ADFS will use a default resource urn:microsoft:userinfo. userinfo resource polices such as MFA, Issuance or authorization policy, can't be customized.|
|response_mode|optional| Specifies the method that should be used to send the resulting token back to your app. Defaults to `fragment`.|
|state|optional|A value included in the request that will also be returned in the token response. It can be a string of any content that you wish. A randomly generated unique value is typically used for preventing cross-site request forgery attacks. The state is also used to encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on.|
|prompt|optional|Indicates the type of user interaction that is required. The only valid values at this time are login, and none.</br>- `prompt=login` will force the user to enter their credentials on that request, negating single-sign on. </br>- `prompt=none` is the opposite - it will ensure that the user isn't presented with any interactive prompt whatsoever. If the request can't be completed silently via single-sign on, AD FS will return an interaction_required error.|
|login_hint|optional|Can be used to pre-fill the username/email address field of the sign in page for the user, if you know their username ahead of time. Often apps will use this parameter during re-authentication, having already extracted the username from a previous sign-in using the `upn` claim from `id_token`.|
|domain_hint|optional|If included, it will skip the domain-based discovery process that user goes through on the sign in page, leading to a slightly more streamlined user experience.|

At this point, the user will be asked to enter their credentials and complete the authentication. Once the user authenticates, the AD FS authorize endpoint will return a response to your app at the indicated redirect_uri, using the method specified in the response_mode parameter.

### Successful response

A successful response using `response_mode=fragment and response_type=id_token+token` looks like the following

```
// Line breaks for legibility only

GET https://localhost/myapp/#
access_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZEstZnl0aEV...
&token_type=Bearer
&expires_in=3599
&scope=openid
&id_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZstZnl0aEV1Q...
&state=12345
```


|Parameter|Description|
|-----|-----|
|access_token|Included if response_type includes `token`.|
|token_type|Included if response_type includes `token`. Will always be Bearer.|
|expires_in| Included if response_type includes `token`. Indicates the number of seconds the token is valid, for caching purposes.|
|scope| Indicates the scope(s) for which the access_token will be valid.|
|id_token|Included if response_type includes `id_token`. A signed JSON Web Token (JWT). The app can decode the segments of this token to request information about the user who signed in. The app can cache the values and display them, but it shouldn't rely on them for any authorization or security boundaries.|
|state|If a state parameter is included in the request, the same value should appear in the response. The app should verify that the state values in the request and response are identical.|

### Refresh tokens
The implicit grant does not provide refresh tokens. Both `id_tokens` and `access_tokens` will expire after a short period of time, so your app must be prepared to refresh these tokens periodically. To refresh either type of token, you can perform the same hidden iframe request from above using the `prompt=none` parameter to control the identity platform's behavior. If you want to receive a `new id_token`, be sure to use `response_type=id_token`.

## Authorization code grant flow

The OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant can be used in web apps to gain access to protected resources, such as web APIs. The OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow is described in [section 4.1 of the OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). It's used to perform authentication and authorization in the majority of app types, including web apps and natively installed apps. The flow enables apps to securely acquire access_tokens that can be used to access resources which trust AD FS.

### Protocol Diagram

At a high level, the authentication flow for a native application looks a bit like this:

![Authorization code grant flow](media/adfs-scenarios-for-developers/authorization.png)

### Request an authorization code

The authorization code flow begins with the client directing the user to the /authorize endpoint. In this request, the client indicates the permissions it needs to acquire from the user:

```
// Line breaks for legibility only

https://adfs.contoso.com/adfs/oauth2/authorize?
client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&response_type=code
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&response_mode=query
&resource=https://webapi.com/
&scope=openid
&state=12345
```

|Parameter|Required/Optional|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|client_id|required|The Application (client) ID that the AD FS assigned to your app.|
|response_type|required| Must include code for the authorization code flow.|
|redirect_uri|required|The `redirect_uri` of your app, where authentication responses can be sent and received by your app. It must exactly match one of the redirect_uris you registered in the AD FS for the client.|
|resource|optional|The url of your Web API.</br>Note – If using MSAL client library, then resource parameter is not sent. Instead the resource url is sent as a part of the scope parameter: `scope = [resource url]//[scope values e.g., openid]`</br>If resource is not passed here or in scope ADFS will use a default resource urn:microsoft:userinfo. userinfo resource polices such as MFA, Issuance or authorization policy, can't be customized.|
|scope|optional|A space-separated list of scopes.|
|response_mode|optional|Specifies the method that should be used to send the resulting token back to your app. Can be one of the following: </br>- query </br>- fragment </br>- form_post</br>`query` provides the code as a query string parameter on your redirect URI. If you're requesting the code, you can use query, fragment, or form_post. `form_post` executes a POST containing the code to your redirect URI.|
|state|optional|A value included in the request that will also be returned in the token response. It can be a string of any content that you wish. A randomly generated unique value is typically used for preventing cross-site request forgery attacks. The value can also encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on.|
|prompt|optional|Indicates the type of user interaction that is required. The only valid values at this time are login, and none.</br>- `prompt=login` will force the user to enter their credentials on that request, negating single-sign on. </br>- `prompt=none` is the opposite - it will ensure that the user isn't presented with any interactive prompt whatsoever. If the request can't be completed silently via single-sign on, AD FS will return an interaction_required error.|
|login_hint|optional|Can be used to pre-fill the username/email address field of the sign-in page for the user, if you know their username ahead of time. Often apps will use this parameter during re-authentication, having already extracted the username from a previous sign-in using the `upn`claim from `id_token`.|
|domain_hint|optional|If included, it will skip the domain-based discovery process that user goes through on the sign in page, leading to a slightly more streamlined user experience.|
|code_challenge_method|optional|The method used to encode the code_verifier for the code_challenge parameter. Can be one of the following values: </br>- plain </br>- S256 </br>If excluded, code_challenge is assumed to be plaintext if `code_challenge` is included. AD FS supports both plain and S256. For more information, see the [PKCE RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636).|
|code_challenge|optional| Used to secure authorization code grants via Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) from a native client. Required if `code_challenge_method` is included. For more information, see the [PKCE RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)|

At this point, the user will be asked to enter their credentials and complete the authentication. Once the user authenticates, the AD FS will return a response to your app at the indicated `redirect_uri`, using the method specified in the `response_mode` parameter.

### Successful response

A successful response using response_mode=query looks like:

```
GET https://adfs.contoso.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient?
code=AwABAAAAvPM1KaPlrEqdFSBzjqfTGBCmLdgfSTLEMPGYuNHSUYBrq...
&state=12345
```


|Parameter|Description|
|-----|-----|
|code|The `authorization_code` that the app requested. The app can use the authorization code to request an access token for the target resource. Authorization_codes are short lived, typically they expire after about 10 minutes.|
|state|If a `state` parameter is included in the request, the same value should appear in the response. The app should verify that the state values in the request and response are identical.|

### Request an access token

Now that you've acquired an `authorization_code` and have been granted permission by the user, you can redeem the code for an `access_token` to the desired resource. Do this by sending a POST request to the /token endpoint:

```
// Line breaks for legibility only

POST /adfs/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: https://adfs.contoso.com/
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&code=OAAABAAAAiL9Kn2Z27UubvWFPbm0gLWQJVzCTE9UkP3pSx1aXxUjq3n8b2JRLk4OxVXr...
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&grant_type=authorization_code
&client_secret=JqQX2PNo9bpM0uEihUPzyrh    // NOTE: Only required for confidential clients (web apps)
```

|Parameter|Required/optional|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|client_id|required|The Application (client) ID that the AD FS assigned to your app.|
|grant_type|required|Must be `authorization_code` for the authorization code flow.|
|code|required|The `authorization_code` that you acquired in the first leg of the flow.|
|redirect_uri|required|The same `redirect_uri` value that was used to acquire the `authorization_code`.|
|client_secret|required for web apps|The application secret that you created during app registration in AD FS. You shouldn't use the application secret in a native app because client_secrets can't be reliably stored on devices. It's required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client_secret securely on the server side. The client secret must be URL-encoded before being sent. These apps can also use a key based authentication by signing a JWT and adding that as client_assertion parameter.|
|code_verifier|optional|The same `code_verifier` that was used to obtain the authorization_code. Required if PKCE was used in the authorization code grant request. For more information, see the [PKCE RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636).</br>Note – Applies to AD FS 2019 and later|

### Successful response

A successful token response will look like:

```
{
    "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q...",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3599,
    "refresh_token": "AwABAAAAvPM1KaPlrEqdFSBzjqfTGAMxZGUTdM0t4B4...",
    "refresh_token_expires_in": 28800,
    "id_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJhdWQiOiIyZDRkMTFhMi1mODE0LTQ2YTctOD...",
}
```


|Parameter|Description|
|-----|-----|
|access_token|The requested access token. The app can use this token to authenticate to the secured resource (Web API).|
|token_type|Indicates the token type value. The only type that AD FS supports is Bearer.
|expires_in|How long the access token is valid (in seconds).
|refresh_token|An OAuth 2.0 refresh token. The app can use this token acquire additional access tokens after the current access token expires. Refresh_tokens are long-lived, and can be used to retain access to resources for extended periods of time.|
|refresh_token_expires_in|How long the refresh token is valid (in seconds).|
|id_token|A JSON Web Token (JWT). The app can decode the segments of this token to request information about the user who signed in. The app can cache the values and display them, but it should not rely on them for any authorization or security boundaries.|

### Use the access token

```
GET /v1.0/me/messages
Host: https://webapi.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q...
 ```

### Refresh Token Grant Flow
 
Access_tokens are short lived, and you must refresh them after they expire to continue accessing resources. You can do so by submitting another POST request to the `/token` endpoint, this time providing the refresh_token instead of the code. Refresh tokens are valid for all permissions that your client has already received access token for.

Refresh tokens do not have specified lifetimes. Typically, the lifetimes of refresh tokens are relatively long. However, in some cases, refresh tokens expire, are revoked, or lack sufficient privileges for the desired action. Your application needs to expect and handle errors returned by the token issuance endpoint correctly.

Although refresh tokens aren't revoked when used to acquire new access tokens, you are expected to discard the old refresh token. As per the OAuth 2.0 spec says: "The authorization server MAY issue a new refresh token, in which case the client MUST discard the old refresh token and replace it with the new refresh token. The authorization server MAY revoke the old refresh token after issuing a new refresh token to the client." AD FS issues refresh token when the new refresh token lifetime is longer than previous refresh token lifetime.  To view additional information on AD FS refresh token lifetimes, visit [AD FS Single Sign On Settings](../operations/ad-fs-single-sign-on-settings.md).

These apps can also use a key based authentication by signing a JWT and adding that as client_assertion parameter.|

### Successful response
A successful token response will look like:

```
{
    "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q...",

|id_token|A JSON Web Token (JWT). The app can decode the segments of this token to request information about the user who signed in. The app can cache the values and display them, but it should not rely on them for any authorization or security boundaries.|

## On-Behalf-Of flow

The OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of flow (OBO) serves the use case where an application invokes a service/web API, which in turn needs to call another service/web API. The idea is to propagate the delegated user identity and permissions through the request chain. For the middle-tier service to make authenticated requests to the downstream service, it needs to secure an access token from the AD FS, on behalf of the user.

### Protocol diagram
Assume that the user has been authenticated on an application using the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow described above. At this point, the application has an access token for API A (token A) with the user's claims and consent to access the middle-tier web API (API A). Make sure the client requests for user_impersonation scope in the token. Now, API A needs to make an authenticated request to the downstream web API (API B).

The steps that follow constitute the OBO flow and are explained with the help of the following diagram.

![On-Behalf-Of flow](media/adfs-scenarios-for-developers/obo.png)

  1. The client application makes a request to API A with token A.
  Note: While configuring OBO flow in AD FS make sure scope `user_impersonation` is selected and client do request `user_impersonation` scope in the request.
  2. API A authenticates to the AD FS token issuance endpoint and requests a token to access API B. Note: While configuring this flow in AD FS make sure API A is also registered as a server application with clientID having the same value as the resource ID in API A.
  3. The AD FS token issuance endpoint validates API A's credentials with token A and issues the access token for API B (token B).
  4. Token B is set in the authorization header of the request to API B.
  5. Data from the secured resource is returned by API B.

### Service-to-service access token request

To request an access token, make an HTTP POST to the AD FS token endpoint with the following parameters.


### First case: Access token request with a shared secret

When using a shared secret, a service-to-service access token request contains the following parameters:


|Parameter|Required/Optional|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|grant_type|required|The type of token request. For a request using a JWT, the value must be urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer.|
|client_id|required|The Client ID that you configure when registering your first Web API as a server app (middle tier app). This should be the same as the resource ID used in the 1st leg i.e. url of the first Web API.|
|client_secret|required|The application secret that you created during sever app registration in AD FS.|
|assertion|required|The value of the token used in the request.|
|requested_token_use|required|Specifies how the request should be processed. In the OBO flow, the value must be set to on_behalf_of|
|resource|required|The resource ID provided while registering the first Web API as the server app (middle tier App). The resource ID should be the url of second Web API middle tier App will call on behalf of the client.|
|scope|optional|A space separated list of scopes for the token request.|

#### Example

The following `HTTP POST` requests an access token and refresh token

```
//line breaks for legibility only

POST /adfs/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: adfs.contoso.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
&client_id=https://webapi.com/
&client_secret=BYyVnAt56JpLwUcyo47XODd
&assertion=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIm…
&resource=https://secondwebapi.com/
&requested_token_use=on_behalf_of
&scope=openid
```

### Second case: Access token request with a certificate

A service-to-service access token request with a certificate contains the following parameters:


|Parameter|required/Optional|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|grant_type|required|The type of token request. For a request using a JWT, the value must be urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer. |
|client_id|required|The Client ID that you configure when registering your first Web API as a server app (middle tier app). This should be the same as the resource ID used in the 1st leg i.e. url of the first Web API.|
|client_assertion_type|required|The value must be urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer.|
|client_assertion|required|An assertion (a JSON web token) that you need to create and sign with the certificate you registered as credentials for your application.|
|assertion|required|The value of the token used in the request.|
|requested_token_use|required|Specifies how the request should be processed. In the OBO flow, the value must be set to on_behalf_of|
|resource|required|The resource ID provided while registering the first Web API as the server app (middle tier App). The resource ID should be the url of second Web API middle tier App will call on behalf of the client.|
|scope|optional|A space separated list of scopes for the token request.|


Notice that the parameters are almost the same as in the case of the request by shared secret except that the client_secret parameter is replaced by two parameters: client_assertion_type and client_assertion.

#### Example
The following HTTP POST requests an access token for the Web API with a certificate.

```
// line breaks for legibility only

POST /adfs/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1

### Service to service access token response

A success response is a JSON OAuth 2.0 response with the following parameters.


|Parameter|Description|
|-----|-----|
|token_type|Indicates the token type value. The only type that AD FS supports is Bearer. |
|scope|The scope of access granted in the token.|
|expires_in|The length of time, in seconds, that the access token is valid.|
|access_token|The requested access token. The calling service can use this token to authenticate to the receiving service.|
|id_token|A JSON Web Token (JWT). The app can decode the segments of this token to request information about the user who signed in. The app can cache the values and display them, but it should not rely on them for any authorization or security boundaries.|
|refresh_token|The refresh token for the requested access token. The calling service can use this token to request another access token after the current access token expires.|
|Refresh_token_expires_in|The length of time, in seconds, that the refresh token is valid.

### Success response example

The following example shows a success response to a request for an access token for the web API.

```
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": openid,
  "expires_in": 3269,
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJub25jZSI6IkFRQUJBQUFBQUFCbmZpRy1t"
  "id_token": "aWRfdG9rZW49ZXlKMGVYQWlPaUpLVjFRaUxDSmhiR2NpT2lKU1V6STFOa"
  "refresh_token": "OAQABAAAAAABnfiG…"
  "refresh_token_expires_in": 28800,
}
```


Use the access token to access the secured resource
Now the middle-tier service can use the token acquired above to make authenticated requests to the downstream web API, by setting the token in the Authorization header.

#### Example
```
GET /v1.0/me HTTP/1.1
Host: https://secondwebapi.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJub25jZSI6IkFRQUJBQUFBQUFCbmZpRy1tQ…
```

## Client credentials grant flow

You can use the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant specified in [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4), to access web-hosted resources by using the identity of an application. This type of grant is commonly used for server-to-server interactions that must run in the background, without immediate interaction with a user. These types of applications are often referred to as daemons or service accounts.

The OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant flow permits a web service (confidential client) to use its own credentials, instead of impersonating a user, to authenticate when calling another web service. In this scenario, the client is typically a middle-tier web service, a daemon service, or a web site. For a higher level of assurance, the AD FS also allows the calling service to use a certificate (instead of a shared secret) as a credential.

### Protocol diagram

The following diagram shows the client credentials grant flow.

![Client credentials](media/adfs-scenarios-for-developers/credentials.png)

### Request a token

To get a token by using the client credentials grant, send a `POST` request to the /token AD FS endpoint:

### First case: Access token request with a shared secret

```
POST /adfs/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
//Line breaks for clarity

Host: https://adfs.contoso.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=535fb089-9ff3-47b6-9bfb-4f1264799865
&client_secret=qWgdYAmab0YSkuL1qKv5bPX
&grant_type=client_credentials
```

|Parameter|Required/Optional|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|client_id|required|The Application (client) ID that the AD FS assigned to your app.|
|scope|optional|A space-separated list of scopes that you want the user to consent to.|
|client_secret|required|The client secret that you generated for your app in the app registration portal. The client secret must be URL-encoded before being sent.|
|grant_type|required|Must be set to `client_credentials`.|

### Second case: Access token request with a certificate

```
POST /adfs/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1

// Line breaks for clarity

Host: https://adfs.contoso.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

&client_id=97e0a5b7-d745-40b6-94fe-5f77d35c6e05
&client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer
&client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Imd4OHRHeXN5amNScUtqRlBuZDdSRnd2d1pJMCJ9.eyJ{a lot of characters here}M8U3bSUKKJDEg
&grant_type=client_credentials
```

|Parameter|Required/Optional|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|client_assertion_type|required|The value must be set to urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer.|
|client_assertion|required|An assertion (a JSON web token) that you need to create and sign with the certificate you registered as credentials for your application.|
|grant_type|required|Must be set to `client_credentials`.|
|client_id|optional|The Application (client) ID that the AD FS assigned to your app. This is part of client_assertion, so it is not required to be passed in here.|
|scope|optional|A space-separated list of scopes that you want the user to consent to.|

### Use a token

Now that you've acquired a token, use the token to make requests to the resource. When the token expires, repeat the request to the /token endpoint to acquire a fresh access token.

```
GET /v1.0/me/messages
Host: https://webapi.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q...
```

## Resource owner password credentials grant flow (Not recommended)

Resource owner password credential (ROPC) grant allows an application to sign in the user by directly handling their password. The ROPC flow requires a high degree of trust and user exposure and you should only use this flow when other, more secure, flows can't be used.

### Protocol diagram

The following diagram shows the ROPC flow.

![ROPC flow](media/adfs-scenarios-for-developers/resource.png)

### Authorization request
The ROPC flow is a single request—it sends the client identification and user's credentials to the IDP, and then receives tokens in return. The client must request the user's email address (UPN) and password before doing so. Immediately after a successful request, the client should securely release the user's credentials from memory. It must never save them.

POST /adfs/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: https://adfs.contoso.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&scope= openid
&username=myusername@contoso.com
&password=SuperS3cret
&grant_type=password
```


|Parameter|Required/Optional|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|client_id|required|Client ID|
|grant_type|required|Must be set to password.|
|username|required|The user's email address.|
|password|required|The user's password.|
|scope|optional|A space-separated list of scopes.|

### Successful authentication response
The following example shows a successful token response:

```
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "scope": "openid",
    "expires_in": 3599,
    "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIn...",
    "refresh_token": "AwABAAAAvPM1KaPlrEqdFSBzjqfTGAMxZGUTdM0t4B4...",
    "refresh_token_expires_in": 28800,
    "id_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJhdWQiOiIyZDR..."
}
```


|Parameter|Description|
|-----|-----|
|token_type|Always set to Bearer.|
|scope|If an access token was returned, this parameter lists the scopes the access token is valid for.|
|expires_in|Number of seconds that the included access token is valid for.|
|access_token|Issued for the scopes that were requested.|
|id_token|A JSON Web Token (JWT). The app can decode the segments of this token to request information about the user who signed in. The app can cache the values and display them, but it should not rely on them for any authorization or security boundaries.|
|refresh_token_expires_in|Number of seconds that the included refresh token is valid for.|
|refresh_token|Issued if the original scope parameter included offline_access.|

You can use the refresh token to acquire new access tokens and refresh tokens using the same flow described in the auth code grant flow section above.

## Device code flow

Device code grant allows users to sign in to input-constrained devices such as a smart TV, IoT device, or printer. To enable this flow, the device has the user visit a webpage in their browser on another device to sign in. Once the user signs in, the device is able to get access tokens and refresh tokens as needed.

### Protocol diagram

The entire device code flow looks similar to the next diagram. We describe each of the steps later in this article.

![Device code flow](media/adfs-scenarios-for-developers/device.png)

### Device authorization request
The client must first check with the authentication server for a device and user code that's used to initiate authentication. The client collects this request from the /devicecode endpoint. In this request, the client should also include the permissions it needs to acquire from the user. From the moment this request is sent, the user has only 15 minutes to sign in (the usual value for expires_in), so only make this request when the user has indicated they're ready to sign in.

```
// Line breaks are for legibility only.

POST https://adfs.contoso.com/adfs/oauth2/devicecode
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
scope=openid
```


|Parameter|Condition|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|client_id|required|The Application (client) ID that the AD FS assigned to your app.|
|scope|optional|A space-separated list of scopes.|

### Device authorization response
A successful response will be a JSON object containing the required information to allow the user to sign in.


|Parameter|Description|
|-----|-----|
|device_code|A long string used to verify the session between the client and the authorization server. The client uses this parameter to request the access token from the authorization server.|
|user_code|A short string shown to the user that's used to identify the session on a secondary device.|
|verification_uri|The URI the user should go to with the user_code in order to sign in.|
|verification_uri_complete|The URI the user should go to with the user_code in order to sign in. This is prefilled with user_code so that user doesn't need to enter user_code|
|expires_in|The number of seconds before the device_code and user_code expire.|
|interval|The number of seconds the client should wait between polling requests.|
|message|A human-readable string with instructions for the user. This can be localized by including a query parameter in the request of the form ?mkt=xx-XX, filling in the appropriate language culture code.

### Authenticating the user
After receiving the user_code and verification_uri, the client displays these to the user, instructing them to sign in using their mobile phone or PC browser. Additionally, the client can use a QR code or similar mechanism to display the verfication_uri_complete, which will take the step of entering the user_code for the user.
While the user is authenticating at the verification_uri, the client should be polling the /token endpoint for the requested token using the device_code.

```
POST https://adfs.contoso.com /adfs/oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type: urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
client_id: 6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
device_code: GMMhmHCXhWEzkobqIHGG_EnNYYsAkukHspeYUk9E8
```


|Parameter|required|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
|grant_type|required|Must be urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code|
|client_id|required|Must match the client_id used in the initial request.|
|code|required|The device_code returned in the device authorization request.|

### Successful authentication response
A successful token response will look like:


|Parameter|Description|
|-----|-----|
|token_type|Always "Bearer.|
|scope|If an access token was returned, this lists the scopes the access token is valid for.|
|expires_in|Number of seconds before the included access token is valid for.|
|access_token|Issued for the scopes that were requested.|
|id_token|Issued if the original scope parameter included the openid scope.|
|refresh_token|Issued if the original scope parameter included offline_access.|
|refresh_token_expires_in|Number of seconds before the included refresh token is valid for.|
