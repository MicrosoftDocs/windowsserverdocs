# Planning Federation Server Proxy Placement
After you gather all the information that you will use to design your Active Directory Federation Services \(AD FS\) infrastructure and after you plan your federation server and Web server strategy, you can plan when and where to place federation server proxies in your new design. The information in the following topics can help you determine when and where to place a federation server proxy and whether to configure it for the account partner role or the resource partner role:  
  
-   [Review the Role of the Federation Server in the Account Partner](Review-the-Role-of-the-Federation-Server-in-the-Account-Partner.md)  
  
-   [Review the Role of the Federation Server Proxy in the Resource Partner](Review-the-Role-of-the-Federation-Server-Proxy-in-the-Resource-Partner.md)  
  
-   [When to Create a Federation Server Proxy](When-to-Create-a-Federation-Server-Proxy.md)  
  
-   [Where to Place a Federation Server Proxy](Where-to-Place-a-Federation-Server-Proxy.md)  
  
-   [When to Create a Federation Server Proxy Farm](When-to-Create-a-Federation-Server-Proxy-Farm.md)  
  
-   [Certificate Requirements for Federation Server Proxies](Certificate-Requirements-for-Federation-Server-Proxies.md)  
  
-   [Name Resolution Requirements for Federation Server Proxies](Name-Resolution-Requirements-for-Federation-Server-Proxies.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Although this information might help with your placement planning for federation server proxies, it does not explain how to determine the proper number of proxies and the proxy hardware requirements for each AD FS design.  
  
For examples of how you can place a federation server proxy in either of the two primary AD FS design scenarios, see [Mapping Your Deployment Goals to an AD FS Design](Mapping-Your-Deployment-Goals-to-an-AD-FS-Design.md).
