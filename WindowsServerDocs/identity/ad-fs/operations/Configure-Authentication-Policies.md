# Configure Authentication Policies

In AD FS, in Windows Server 2012 R2, both access control and the authentication mechanism are enhanced with multiple factors that include user, device, location, and authentication data. These enhancements enable you, either through the user interface or through Windows PowerShell, to manage the risk of granting access permissions to AD FS\-secured applications via multi\-factor access control and multi\-factor authentication that are based on user identity or group membership, network location, device data that is workplace\-joined, and the authentication state when multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) was performed.

For more information about MFA and multi\-factor access control in Active Directory Federation Services \(AD FS\) in  Windows Server 2012 R2 , see the following topics:


-   [Join to Workplace from Any Device for SSO and Seamless Second Factor Authentication Across Company Applications](../../ad-fs/operations/Join-to-Workplace-from-Any-Device-for-SSO-and-Seamless-Second-Factor-Authentication-Across-Company-Applications.md)

-   [Manage Risk with Conditional Access Control](../../ad-fs/operations/Manage-Risk-with-Conditional-Access-Control.md)

## Configure authentication policies via the AD FS Management snap\-in
Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum requirement to complete these procedures.  Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).

In AD FS, in Windows Server 2012 R2, you can specify an authentication policy at a global scope that is applicable to all applications and services that are secured by AD FS. You can also set authentication policies for specific applications and services that rely on party trusts and are secured by AD FS. Specifying an authentication policy for a particular application per relying party trust does not override the global authentication policy. If either global or per relying party trust authentication policy requires MFA, MFA is triggered when the user tries to authenticate to this relying party trust. The global authentication policy is a fallback for relying party trusts for applications and services that do not have a specific configured authentication policy.

## To configure primary authentication globally in Windows Server 2012 R2

1.  In Server Manager, click **Tools**, and then select **AD FS Management**.

2.  In AD FS snap\-in, click **Authentication Policies**.

3.  In the **Primary Authentication** section, click **Edit** next to **Global Settings**. You can also right\-click **Authentication Policies**, and select **Edit Global Primary Authentication**, or, under the **Actions** pane, select **Edit Global Primary Authentication**.

4.  In the **Edit Global Authentication Policy** window, on the **Primary** tab, you can configure the following settings as part of the global authentication policy:

    -   Authentication methods to be used for primary authentication. You can select available authentication methods under the **Extranet** and **Intranet**.

    -   Device authentication via the **Enable device authentication** check box. For more information, see [Join to Workplace from Any Device for SSO and Seamless Second Factor Authentication Across Company Applications](../../ad-fs/operations/Join-to-Workplace-from-Any-Device-for-SSO-and-Seamless-Second-Factor-Authentication-Across-Company-Applications.md).

## To configure multi-factor authentication globally

1.  In Server Manager, click **Tools**, and then select **AD FS Management**.

2.  In AD FS snap\-in, click **Authentication Policies**.

3.  In the **Multi\-factor Authentication** section, click **Edit** next to **Global Settings**. You can also right\-click **Authentication Policies**, and select **Edit Global Multi\-factor Authentication**, or, under the **Actions** pane, select **Edit Global Multi\-factor Authentication**.
![Screenshot that highlights the Edit Global Multi\-factor Authentication option.](media/Configure-Authentication-Policies/authpolicy8.png)

4.  In the **Edit Global Authentication Policy** window, under the **Multi\-factor** tab, you can configure the following settings as part of the global multi\-factor authentication policy:

    -   Settings or conditions for MFA via available options under the **Users\/Groups**, **Devices**, and **Locations** sections.

    -   To enable MFA for any of these settings, you must select at least one additional authentication method. **Certificate Authentication** is the default available option. You can also configure other custom additional authentication methods, for example, Windows Azure Active Authentication. For more information, see [Walkthrough Guide: Manage Risk with Additional Multi-Factor Authentication for Sensitive Applications](../../ad-fs/operations/Walkthrough-Guide--Manage-Risk-with-Additional-Multi-Factor-Authentication-for-Sensitive-Applications.md).

    -   Settings or conditions for MFA via available options under the **Users\/Groups**, **Devices**, and **Locations** sections.

## Configure authentication policies via Windows PowerShell
Windows PowerShell enables greater flexibility in using various factors of access control and the authentication mechanism that are available in AD FS in  Windows Server 2012 R2  to configure authentication policies and authorization rules that are necessary to implement true conditional access for your AD FS \-secured resources.

Membership in Administrators, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum requirement to complete these procedures.  Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)) \(http:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkId\=83477\).

### To configure an additional authentication method via Windows PowerShell

1.  On your federation server, open the Windows PowerShell command window and run the following command.


~~~
`Set-AdfsGlobalAuthenticationPolicy –AdditionalAuthenticationProvider CertificateAuthentication  `
~~~


> [!WARNING]
> To verify that this command ran successfully, you can run the `Get-AdfsGlobalAuthenticationPolicy` command.

### To configure MFA per\-relying party trust that is based on a user's group membership data

1.  On your federation server, open the Windows PowerShell command window and run the following command:


~~~
`$rp = Get-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust –Name relying_party_trust`
~~~


> [!WARNING]
> Ensure to replace *<relying\_party\_trust>* with the name of your relying party trust.

2. In the same Windows PowerShell command window, run the following command.


~~~
$MfaClaimRule = "c:[Type == '"https://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/groupsid'", Value =~ '"^(?i) <group_SID>$'"] => issue(Type = '"https://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/authenticationmethod'", Value '"https://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/multipleauthn'");"

Set-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust –TargetRelyingParty $rp –AdditionalAuthenticationRules $MfaClaimRule
~~~


> [!NOTE]
> Ensure to replace <group\_SID> with the value of the security identifier \(SID\) of your Active Directory \(AD\) group.

### To configure MFA globally based on users' group membership data

1.  On your federation server, open the Windows PowerShell command window and run the following command.
