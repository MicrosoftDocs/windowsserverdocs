# Configure Additional Authentication Methods for AD FS

In order to enable multifactor authentication (MFA), you must select at least one extra authentication method. By default, in Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) in Windows Server, you can select Certificate Authentication (in other words, smart card-based authentication) as an extra authentication method.

> [!NOTE]
> If you select Certificate Authentication, ensure that the smart card certificates have been provisioned securely and have pin requirements.

## Microsoft and third-party authentication methods

You can also configure and enable Microsoft and third-party authentication methods in AD FS in Windows Server. Once installed and registered with AD FS, you can enforce MFA as part of the global or per-relying-party authentication policy.

Below is an alphabetical list of Microsoft and third-party providers with MFA offerings currently available for AD FS in Windows Server.
