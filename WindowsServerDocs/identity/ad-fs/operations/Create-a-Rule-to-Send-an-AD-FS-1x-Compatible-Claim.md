# Create a Rule to Send an AD FS 1.x Compatible Claim

In situations in which you are using Active Directory Federation Services \(AD FS\) to issue claims that will be received by federation servers running AD FS 1.0 \(Windows Server 2003 R2\) or AD FS 1.1 \(Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2\), you must do the following:

-   Create a rule that will send a Name ID claim type with a format of UPN, Email, or Common Name.

-   All other claims that are sent must have one of the following claim types:

    -   AD FS 1.*x* Email Address

    -   AD FS 1.*x* UPN

    -   Common Name

    -   Group

    -   Any other claim type that begins with https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/, such as https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/EmployeeID

Depending on the needs of your organization, use one of the following procedures to create an AD FS 1.*x* compatible NameID claim:

-   Create this rule to issue an AD FS 1.x Name ID claim using the **Pass Through or Filter an Incoming Claim rule template**

-   Create this rule to issue an AD FS 1.x Name ID claim using the **Transform an Incoming Claim rule template**. You can use this rule template in situations in which you want to change the existing claim type to a new claim type that will work with AD FS 1. *x* claims.

> [!NOTE]
> For this rule to work as expected, make sure that the relying party trust or claims provider trust where you are creating this rule has been configured to use the **AD FS 1.0 and 1.1 profile**.
