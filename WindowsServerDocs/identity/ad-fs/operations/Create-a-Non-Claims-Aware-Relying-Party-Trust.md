# Create a Non-Claims-Aware Relying Party Trust


In the AD FS Management snap\-in, non\-claims\-aware relying party trusts are objects that are created to represent the trust between the federation service and a single web\-based application that is not claims\-aware and that is accessed through the Web Application Proxy.

A non\-claims\-aware relying party trust is a relying party trust which consists of identifiers, names, and rules for authentication and authorization when the relying party trust is accessed through the Web Application Proxy. These web\-based applications that do not rely on claims, in other words, these Integrated Windows Authentication\-based applications, can have authorization rules that enforce access that is based on claims when the access is external to the corporate network through the Web Application Proxy.

To add a new non\-claims\-aware relying party trust, by using the AD FS Management snap\-in, perform the following procedure.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure.  Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).
