# Create a Rule to Send an Authentication Method Claim


You can use either the **Send Group Membership as Claims** rule template or the **Transform an Incoming Claim** rule template to send an authentication method claim. The relying party can use an authentication method claim to determine the logon mechanism that the user uses to authenticate and obtain claims from Active Directory Federation Services \(AD FS\). You can also use the Authentication Mechanism Assurance feature of Active Directory Federation Services \(AD FS\) in  Windows Server 2012 R2  as input to generate authentication method claims for situations in which the relying party wants to determine the level of access that is based on smart card logons. For example, a developer can assign different levels of access to federated users of the relying party application. The levels of access are based on whether the users log on with their user name and password credentials, as opposed to their smart cards.

Depending on the requirements of your organization, use one of the following procedures:

-   Create this rule by using the **Send Group Membership as Claims** rule template \- You can use this rule template when you want the group that you specify in this template to ultimately determine what authentication method claim to issue.

-   Create this rule by using the **Transform an Incoming Claim** rule template \- You can use this rule template when you want to change the existing authentication method to a new authentication method that works with a product that does not recognize standard AD FS authentication method claims.
