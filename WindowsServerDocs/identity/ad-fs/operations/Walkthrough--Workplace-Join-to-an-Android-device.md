# Walkthrough: Workplace Join to an Android device



## Join your device with Workplace Join

> [!NOTE]
> Android workplace join requires Azure Active Directory Device Registration Service. In order to enforce conditional device policies on-premises, Directory Synchronization Tool (DirSync) must be deployed with device object write-back option enabled. At the present time, device write-back to Active Directory from Azure Active Directory can take up-to 3 hours. As such, users must wait for 3 hours to access on-premises web applications, after creating a work account. For more information about deploying Azure Active Directory Device Registration service, see, [Azure Active Directory Device Registration Service Overview](/previous-versions/azure/dn788908(v=azure.100))

#### Create a Work account that joins your device with workplace Join

1.  You will need to install Azure Authenticator application on your device to create a work account that joins your device with Workplace join. The following URL has instructions on how to install Azure authenticator app on your Android device and add a work account. The work account makes your Android device into a trusted device and provides Single Sign-On (SSO) to the applications on device. You can use the trusted device to access web applications and modern line-of-business applications as recommended by your IT administrator. For more information, see [Azure Authenticator for Android](/azure/multi-factor-authentication/end-user/microsoft-authenticator-app-how-to).
