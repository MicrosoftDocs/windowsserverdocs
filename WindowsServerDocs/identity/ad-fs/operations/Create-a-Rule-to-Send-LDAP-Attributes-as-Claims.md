# Create a Rule to Send LDAP Attributes as Claims


Using the Send LDAP Attributes as Claims rule template in Active Directory Federation Services \(AD FS\), you can create a rule that will select attributes from a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol \(LDAP\) attribute store, such as Active Directory, to send as claims to the relying party. For example, you can use this rule template to create a Send LDAP Attributes as Claims rule that will extract attribute values for authenticated users from the **displayName** and **telephoneNumber** Active Directory attributes and then send those values as two different outgoing claims.

You can also use this rule to send all the user's group memberships. If you want to send only individual group memberships, use the Send Group Membership as a Claim rule template. You can use the following procedure to create a claim rule with the AD FS Management snap\-in.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure.  Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).
