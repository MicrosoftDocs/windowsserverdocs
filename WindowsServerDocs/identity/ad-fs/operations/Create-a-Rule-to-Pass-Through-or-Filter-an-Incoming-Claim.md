# Create a Rule to Pass Through or Filter an Incoming Claim

Using the Pass Through or Filter an Incoming Claim rule template in Active Directory Federation Services \(AD FS\), you can pass through all incoming claims with a selected claim type. You can also filter the values of incoming claims with a selected claim type. For example, you can use this rule template to create a rule that will send all incoming group claims. You can also use this rule to send only user principal name \(UPN\) claims that end with @fabrikam.

You can use the following procedure to create a claim rule with the AD FS Management snap\-in.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure.  Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).
