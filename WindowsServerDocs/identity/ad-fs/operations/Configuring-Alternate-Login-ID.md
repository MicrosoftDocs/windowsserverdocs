# Configuring Alternate Login ID


## What is Alternate Login ID?

In most scenarios, users use their UPN (User Principal Names) to login to their accounts. However, in some environments due to corporate policies or on-premises line-of-business application dependencies, the users may be using some other form of sign-in.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft's recommended best practices are to match UPN to primary SMTP address. This article addresses the small percentage of customers that cannot remediate UPN's to match.

For example, they can be using their email-id for sign-in and that can be different from their UPN. This is particularly a common occurrence in scenarios where their UPN is non-routable. Consider a user Jane Doe with UPN jdoe@contoso.local and email address jdoe@contoso.com. Jane might not be even aware of the UPN as she has always used her email id for signing-in. Use of any other sign-in method instead of UPN constitutes alternate ID. For more information on how the UPN is created see, [Azure AD UserPrincipalName population](/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-userprincipalname).

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) enables federated applications using AD FS to sign-in using alternate ID. This enables administrators to specify an alternative to the default UPN to be used for sign-in. AD FS already supports using any form of user identifier that is accepted by Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). When configured for alternate ID, AD FS allows users to sign in using the configured alternate ID value, say email-id. Using the alternate ID enables you to adopt SaaS providers, such as Office 365 without modifying your on-premises UPNs. It also enables you to support line-of-business service applications with consumer-provisioned identities.

## Alternate id in Azure AD

An organization may have to use alternate ID in the following scenarios:
1. The on-premises domain name is non-routable, ex. Contoso.local and as a result the default user principal name is non-routable (jdoe@contoso.local). Existing UPN cannot be changed due to local application dependencies or company policies. Azure AD and Office 365 require all domain suffixes associated with Azure AD directory to be fully internet routable.
2. The on-premises UPN is not same as the user's email address and to sign-in to Office 365, users use email address and UPN cannot be used due to organizational constraints.
   In the above-mentioned scenarios, alternate ID with AD FS enables users to sign-in to Azure AD without modifying your on-premises UPNs.

## Configure alternate logon ID

Using Azure AD Connect
We recommend using Azure AD connect to configure alternate logon ID for your environment.

- For new configuration of Azure AD Connect, see Connect to Azure AD for detailed instruction on how to configure alternate ID and AD FS farm.
- For existing Azure AD Connect installations, see Changing the user sign-in method for instructions on changing sign-in method to AD FS

When Azure AD Connect is provided details about AD FS environment, it automatically checks for the presence of the right KB on your AD FS and configures AD FS for alternate ID including all necessary right claim rules for Azure AD federation trust. There is no additional step required outside wizard to configure alternate ID.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft recommends using Azure AD Connect to configure alternate logon ID.

### Manually configure alternate ID

In order to configure alternate login ID, you must perform the following tasks:
Configure your AD FS claims provider trusts to enable alternate login ID

1.  If you have Server 2012R2, ensure you have KB2919355 installed on all the AD FS servers. You can get it via Windows Update Services or download it directly.

2.  Update the AD FS configuration by running the following PowerShell cmdlet on any of the federation servers in your farm (if you have a WID farm, you must run this command on the primary AD FS server in your farm):

``` powershell
Set-AdfsClaimsProviderTrust -TargetIdentifier "AD AUTHORITY" -AlternateLoginID <attribute> -LookupForests <forest domain>
```

**AlternateLoginID** is the LDAP name of the attribute that you want to use for login.

**LookupForests** is the list of forest DNS that your users belong to.

To enable alternate login ID feature, you must configure both -AlternateLoginID and -LookupForests parameters with a non-null, valid value.

In the following example, you are enabling alternate login ID functionality such that your users with accounts in contoso.com and fabrikam.com forests can log in to AD FS-enabled applications with their "mail" attribute.

``` powershell
Set-AdfsClaimsProviderTrust -TargetIdentifier "AD AUTHORITY" -AlternateLoginID mail -LookupForests contoso.com,fabrikam.com
```

3. To disable this feature, set the value for both parameters to be null.

``` powershell
Set-AdfsClaimsProviderTrust -TargetIdentifier "AD AUTHORITY" -AlternateLoginID $NULL -LookupForests $NULL
```

## Hybrid Modern Authentication with Alternate-ID

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following has only been tested against AD FS and not 3rd party identity providers.

### Exchange and Skype for Business

If you are using alternate login id with Exchange and Skype for Business, the user experience varies depending on whether or not you are using HMA.

> [!NOTE]
> For the best end-user experience, Microsoft recommends using Hybrid Modern Authentication.

or more information see, [Hybrid Modern Authentication Overview](https://support.office.com/article/Hybrid-Modern-Authentication-overview-and-prerequisites-for-using-it-with-on-premises-Skype-for-Business-and-Exchange-servers-ef753b32-7251-4c9e-b442-1a5aec14e58d)

### Pre-requisites for Exchange and Skype for Business

The following are pre-requisites for achieving SSO with alternate ID.

- Exchange Online should have Modern Authentication turned ON.
- Skype for Business (SFB) Online should have Modern Authentication turned ON.
- Exchange on-premises should have Modern Authentication turned ON.  Exchange 2013 CU19 or Exchange 2016 CU18 and up is required on all Exchange servers. No Exchange 2010 in the environment.
- Skype for Business on-premises should have Modern Authentication turned ON.
- You must use Exchange and Skype clients that have Modern Authentication enabled. All servers must be running SFB Server 2015 CU5.
- Skype for Business Clients that are Modern Authentication capable
   - iOS, Android, Windows Phone
   - SFB 2016 (MA is ON by default, but make sure it has not been disabled.)
   - SFB 2013 (MA is OFF by default, so ensure MA has been turned ON.)
   - SFB Mac desktop
- Exchange Clients that are Modern Authentication capable and support AltID regkeys
    - Office Pro Plus 2016 only

#### Supported Office version

Configuring your directory for SSO with alternate-id
Using alternate-id can cause extra prompts for authentication if these additional configurations are not completed. Refer to the article for possible impact on user experience with alternate-id.

With the following additional configuration, the user experience is improved significantly, and you can achieve near zero prompts for authentication for alternate-id users in your organization.

##### Step 1. Update to required Office version

Office version 1712 (build no 8827.2148) and above have updated the authentication logic to handle the alternate-id scenario. In order to leverage the new logic, the client machines need to be updated to Office version 1712 (build no 8827.2148) and above.

##### Step 2. Update to required Windows version

Windows version 1709 and above have updated the authentication logic to handle the alternate-id scenario. In order to leverage the new logic, the client machines need to be updated to Windows version 1709 and above.

##### Step 3. Configure registry for impacted users using group policy

The office applications rely on information pushed by the directory administrator to identify the alternate-id environment. The following registry keys need to be configured to help office applications authenticate the user with alternate-id without showing any extra prompts

|Regkey to add|Regkey data name, type, and value|Windows 7/8|Windows 10|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\AuthN|DomainHint</br>REG_SZ</br>contoso.com|Required|Required|The value of this regkey is a verified custom domain name in the tenant of the organization. For example, Contoso corp can provide a value of Contoso.com in this regkey if Contoso.com is one of the verified custom domain names in the tenant Contoso.onmicrosoft.com.|
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity|EnableAlternateIdSupport</br>REG_DWORD</br>1|Required for Outlook 2016 ProPlus|Required for Outlook 2016 ProPlus|The value of this regkey can be 1 / 0 to indicate to Outlook application whether it should engage the improved alternate-id authentication logic.|
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap\Domains\contoso.com\sts|&#42;</br>REG_DWORD</br>1|Required|Required|This regkey can be used to set the STS as a trusted Zone in the internet settings. Standard ADFS deployment recommends adding the ADFS namespace to the Local Intranet Zone for Internet Explorer|

## New authentication flow after additional configuration

![Authentication flow](media/Configure-Alternate-Login-ID/alt1a.png)

1. a: User is provisioned in Azure AD using alternate-id
   </br>b: Directory administrator pushes required regkey settings to impacted client machines
2. User authenticates on the local machine and opens an office application
3. Office application takes the local session credentials
4. Office application authenticates to Azure AD using domain hint pushed by administrator and local credentials
5. Azure AD successfully authenticates the user by directing to correct federation realm and issue a token

## Applications and user experience after the additional configuration

### Non-Exchange and Skype for Business Clients

|Outlook Web Access|Supported|Supported|
|Outlook Mobile Apps for Android, IOS, and Windows Phone|Supported|Supported|
|Skype for Business/ Lync|Supported, with no extra prompts|Supported (except as noted) but there is a potential for user confusion.</br></br>On mobile clients, Alternate Id is supported only if SIP address= email address = Alternate ID.</br></br> Users may need to sign-in twice to the Skype for Business desktop client, first using the on-premises UPN and then using the Alternate ID. (Note that the "Sign-in address" is actually the SIP address which may not be the same as the "User name", though often is). When first prompted for a User name, the user should enter the UPN, even if it is incorrectly pre-populated with the Alternate ID or SIP address. After the user clicks sign-in with the UPN, the User name prompt reappears, this time prepopulated with the UPN. This time the user must replace this with the Alternate ID and click Sign in to complete the sign in process. On mobile clients, users should enter the on-premises user ID in the advanced page, using SAM-style format (domain\username), not UPN format.</br></br>After successful sign-in, if Skype for Business or Lync says "Exchange needs your credentials", you need to provide the credentials that are valid for where the mailbox is located. If the mailbox is in the cloud you need to provide the Alternate ID. If the Mailbox is on-premises you need to provide the on-premises UPN.|

## Additional Details & Considerations

- The Alternate login ID feature is available for federated environments with AD FS deployed.  It is not supported in the following scenarios:
    - Non-routable domains (e.g. Contoso.local) that cannot be verified by Azure AD.
    - Managed environments that do not have AD FS deployed.

- When enabled, the alternate login ID feature is only available for username/password authentication across all the user name/password authentication protocols supported by AD FS (SAML-P, WS-Fed, WS-Trust, and OAuth).

- When Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA) is performed (for example, when users try to access a corporate application on a domain-joined machine from intranet and AD FS administrator has configured the authentication policy to use WIA for intranet), UPN is used for authentication. If you have configured any claim rules for the relying parties for alternate login ID feature, you should make sure those rules are still valid in the WIA case.

- When enabled, the alternate login ID feature requires at least one global catalog server to be reachable from the AD FS server for each user account forest that AD FS supports. Failure to reach a global catalog server in the user account forest results in AD FS falling back to use UPN. By default all the domain controllers are global catalog servers.

- When enabled, if the AD FS server finds more than one user object with the same alternate login ID value specified across all the configured user account forests, it fails the login.

- When alternate login ID feature is enabled, AD FS tries to authenticate the end user with alternate login ID first and then fall back to use UPN if it cannot find an account that can be identified by the alternate login ID. You should make sure there are no clashes between the alternate login ID and the UPN if you want to still support the UPN login. For example, setting one's mail attribute with the other's UPN blocks the other user from signing in with his UPN.

- If one of the forests that is configured by the administrator is down, AD FS continues to look up user account with alternate login ID in other forests that are configured. If AD FS server finds a unique user objects across the forests that it has searched, a user logs in successfully.

- You may additionally want to customize the AD FS sign-in page to give end users some hint about the alternate login ID. You can do it by either adding the customized sign-in page description (for more information, see [Customizing the AD FS Sign-in Pages](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn280950(v=ws.11)) or customizing "Sign in with organizational account" string above username field (for more information, see [Advanced Customization of AD FS Sign-in Pages](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn636121(v=ws.11)).

- The new claim type that contains the alternate login ID value is **http:schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2013/11/alternateloginid**

## Events and Performance Counters

The following performance counters have been added to measure the performance of AD FS servers when alternate login ID is enabled:

- Alternate Login Id Authentications: number of authentications performed by using alternate login ID

- Alternate Login Id Authentications/Sec: number of authentications performed by using alternate login ID per second

- Average Search Latency for Alternate Login ID: average search latency across the forests that an administrator has configured for alternate login ID

The following are various error cases and corresponding impact on a user's sign-in experience with events logged by AD FS:
