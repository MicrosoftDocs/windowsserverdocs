# Create a Relying Party Trust


The following document provides information on creating a relying party trust manually and using federation metadata.

## To create a claims aware Relying Party Trust manually

To add a new relying party trust by using the AD FS Management snap\-in and manually configure the settings, perform the following procedure on a federation server.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure.  Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).

1. In Server Manager, click **Tools**, and then select **AD FS Management**.

2. Under **Actions**, click **Add Relying Party Trust**.

7. On the **Configure URL** page, do one or both of the following, click **Next**, and then go to step 8:

    - Select the **Enable support for the WS\-Federation Passive protocol** check box. Under **Relying party WS\-Federation Passive protocol URL**, type the URL for this relying party trust, and then click **Next**.

    - Select the **Enable support for the SAML 2.0 WebSSO protocol** check box. Under **Relying party SAML 2.0 SSO service URL**, type the Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) service endpoint URL for this relying party trust, and then click **Next**.

## To create a claims aware Relying Party Trust using federation metadata

To add a new relying party trust, using the AD FS Management snap-in, by automatically importing configuration data about the partner from federation metadata that the partner published to a local network or to the Internet, perform the following procedure on a federation server in the account partner organization.

>[!NOTE]
>Though it has long been common practice to use certificates with unqualified host names such as https://myserver, these certificates have no security value and can enable an attacker to impersonate a Federation Service that is publishing federation metadata. Therefore, when querying federation metadata, you should only use a fully qualified domain name such as https://myserver.contoso.com.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure.  Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).

1. In Server Manager, click **Tools**, and then select **AD FS Management**.

2. Under **Actions**, click **Add Relying Party Trust**.

    ![Another screenshot of the AD FS dialog box with the Add Relying Party Trust option in the Actions pane called out.](media/Create-a-Relying-Party-Trust/addtrust1.PNG)

3. On the **Welcome** page, choose **Claims aware** and click **Start**.

    ![Another screenshot of the Welcome page of the Add Relying Party Trust Wizard showing the Claims aware option selected.](media/Create-a-Relying-Party-Trust/addtrust2.PNG)

4. On the **Select Data Source** page, click **Import data about the relying party published online or on a local network**. In **Federation metadata address (host name or URL)**, type the federation metadata URL or host name for the partner, and then click **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Select Data Source page of the Add Relying Party Trust Wizard showing the Import data about the relying party published online or on a local network option selected.](media/Create-a-Relying-Party-Trust/addtrust12.PNG)

5. On the Specify Display Name page type a name in **Display name**, under Notes type a description for this relying party trust, and then click **Next**.

6. On the Choose Issuance Authorization Rules page, select either **Permit all users to access this relying party** or **Deny all users access to this relying party**, and then click **Next**.

7. On the Ready to Add Trust page, review the settings, and then click **Next** to save your relying party trust information.

8. On the Finish page, click **Close**. This action automatically displays the Edit Claim Rules dialog box. For more information about how to proceed with adding claim rules for this relying party trust, see the Additional references.
