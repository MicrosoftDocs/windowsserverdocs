## To create a claims aware Relying Party Trust using federation metadata

To add a new relying party trust, using the AD FS Management snap-in, by automatically importing configuration data about the partner from federation metadata that the partner published to a local network or to the Internet, perform the following procedure on a federation server in the account partner organization.

>[!NOTE]
>Though it has long been common practice to use certificates with unqualified host names such as https://myserver, these certificates have no security value and can enable an attacker to impersonate a Federation Service that is publishing federation metadata. Therefore, when querying federation metadata, you should only use a fully qualified domain name such as https://myserver.contoso.com.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure.  Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=83477).


1. In Server Manager, click **Tools**, and then select **AD FS Management**.  
  
2. Under **Actions**, click **Add Relying Party Trust**.

   ![relying party](media/Create-a-Relying-Party-Trust/addtrust2.PNG) 
  
4. On the **Select Data Source** page, click <strong>Import data about the relying party published online or on a local network*. In **Federation metadata address (host name or URL)</strong>, type the federation metadata URL or host name for the partner, and then click **Next**.

5. On the Specify Display Name page type a name in **Display name**, under Notes type a description for this relying party trust, and then click **Next**.

6. On the Choose Issuance Authorization Rules page, select either **Permit all users to access this relying party** or **Deny all users access to this relying party**, and then click **Next**.

7. On the Ready to Add Trust page, review the settings, and then click **Next** to save your relying party trust information.

8. On the Finish page, click **Close**. This action automatically displays the Edit Claim Rules dialog box. For more information about how to proceed with adding claim rules for this relying party trust, see the Additional references.
