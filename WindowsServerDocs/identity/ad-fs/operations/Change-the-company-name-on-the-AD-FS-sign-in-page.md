# Change the company name on the AD FS sign-in page

To change the name of the company that is displayed on the sign\-in page, use the following Windows PowerShell cmdlet and syntax. This value is set by default by using the value from the Federation Service display name that you entered during setup.

![change name](media/AD-FS-user-sign-in-customization/ADFS_Blue_Custom1.png)

```powershell
    Set-AdfsGlobalWebContent â€“CompanyName "Contoso Corp"
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment \(ISE\) to change the company name. By using the Windows PowerShell ISE, you can display content in a Unicode\-compliant environment. For additional information, see [Introducing the Windows PowerShell ISE](/previous-versions/mt707506(v=msdn.10)).
