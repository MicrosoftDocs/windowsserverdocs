# Enroll an SSL Certificate for AD FS

Active Directory Federation Services \(AD FS\) requires a certificate for Secure Socket Layer \(SSL\) server authentication on each federation server in your federation server farm. The same certificate can be used on each federation server in a farm. You must have both the certificate and its private key available. For example, if you have the certificate and its private key in a .pfx file, you can import the file directly into the Active Directory Federation Services Configuration Wizard. This SSL certificate must contain the following:

1.  The subject name and subject alternative name must contain your federation service name, such as fs.contoso.com.

2.  The subject alternative name must contain the value **enterpriseregistration** that is followed by the User Principal Name \(UPN\) suffix of your organization, for example, **enterpriseregistration.corp.contoso.com**.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Specify the subject alternative name if you plan to enable the Device Registration Service \(DRS\) for Workplace Join.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your organization uses multiple UPN suffixes, and you plan to enable the DRS, the SSL certificate must contain a subject alternative name entry for each suffix.
