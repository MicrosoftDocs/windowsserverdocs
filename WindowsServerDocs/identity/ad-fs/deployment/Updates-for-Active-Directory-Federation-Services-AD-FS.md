This issue occurs when a hardware security module is used to store an ADFS Registration Authority (RA) certificate.|August 2018|
|[4338822 (OS Build 14393.2395)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4338822/windows-10-update-kb4338822)|Addresses an issue in AD FS that shows a duplicate Relying Party trust in the AD FS management console when creating or viewing Relying Party Trusts from the console.</br></br>Addresses an issue in ADFS that causes Windows Hello for Business to fail. The issue occurs when there are two claim providers. PIN registration will fail with, "400 Internal Server Error: Unable to obtain device identifier."</br></br> Addresses a WAP issue related to inactive connections that never end. This leads to system resource leaks (e.g., a memory leak) and to a WAP service that is no longer responsive. Addresses an AD FS issue that prevents users from selecting a different login option.

|[4077525 (OS Build 14393.2097)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4077525/windows-10-update-kb4077525)|Addresses issue where an HTTP 500 error occurs when an ADFS farm has at least two servers using Windows Internal Database (WID). In this scenario, HTTP basic pre-authentication on the Web Application Proxy (WAP) server fails to authenticate some users. When the error occurs, you might also see the Microsoft Windows Web Application Proxy warning Event ID 13039 in the WAP event log. The description reads, "Web Application Proxy failed to authenticate the user. Pre-authentication is 'ADFS For Rich Clients'. The given user is not authorized to access the given relying party. The authorization rules of either the target relying party or the WAP relying party are needed to be modified."</br></br>Addresses issue in which AD FS can no longer ignore prompt=login during authentication.

The failure occurs when using prompt=login if Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA) is enabled and the request can do WIA.</br></br>Addresses issue where AD FS incorrectly displays the Home Realm Discovery (HRD) page when an identity provider (IDP) is associated with a relying party (RP) in an OAuth Group. Unless multiple IDPs are associated with the RP in the OAuth Group, the user will not be shown the HRD page. Instead, the user will go directly to the associated IDP for authentication.|February 2018|
|[4041688 (OS Build 14393.1794)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4041688)|This fix addresses an issue that intermittently misdirects AD Authority requests to the wrong Identity Provider because of incorrect caching behavior. This can effect authentication features like Multi Factor Authentication. </br></br>Added the ability for AAD Connect Health to report ADFS server health with correct fidelity (using verbose auditing) on mixed WS2012R2 and WS2016 ADFS farms.</br></br>Fixed a problem where during upgrade of 2012 R2 ADFS farm to ADFS 2016, the powershell cmdlet to raise the farm behavior level fails with a timeout when there are many relying party trusts.</br></br>Addressed an issue where AD FS causes authentication failures by modifying the wct parameter value while federating the requests to other Security Token Server (STS).|October 2017|
|[4038801 (OS Build 14393.1737)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4038801)|Support added for OIDC logout using federated LDPs. This will allow "Kiosk Scenarios" where multiple users might be serially logged into a single device where there is federation with an LDP.</br></br>Fixed a WinHello issue where CEP/CES based certificates don't work with gMSA accounts.</br></br>Fixes a problem where the Windows Internal Database (WID) on Windows Server 2016 ADFS servers fails to sync some settings, such as the ApplicationGroupId columns from IdentityServerPolicy.Scopes and IdentityServerPolicy.Clients tables)  due to a foreign key constraint. Such sync failures can cause different claim, claim provider and application experiences between primary to secondary ADFS servers. Also, if the WID primary role is moved to a secondary node, application groups will no longer be manageable in the ADFS management UX.</br></br>This update fixes an issues where Multi Factor Authentication does not work correctly with Mobile devices that use custom culture definitions|September 2017|
|[4034661 (OS Build 14393.1613)](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4034661)|Fixes a problem where the caller IP address is nog logged by 411 events in the Security Event log of ADFS 4.0 \ Windows Server 2016 RS1 ADFS servers even after enabling "success audits" and "failure audits".</br></br>This fix addresses an issue with Azure Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) when an ADFX server is configured to use an HTTP Proxy.</br></br>"Addressed an issue where presenting an expired or revoked certificate to the ADFS Proxy server does not return an error to the user."|August 2017|
