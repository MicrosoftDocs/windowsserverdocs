# Join a computer to a domain

For Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to function, each computer that functions as a federation server must be joined to a domain. Federation server proxies can be joined to a domain, but this is not a requirement.

You don't have to join a Web server to a domain if the Web server is hosting claims-aware applications only.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure. Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).

## To join a computer to a domain

1. On the Desktop, click the **Start** button, type **Control Panel**, and then press ENTER.

1. Navigate to **System and Security**, and then click **System**.

1. Under **Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings**, click **Change settings**.

1. Under the **Computer Name** tab, click **Change**.

1. Under **Member of**, click **Domain**, type the name of the domain that you wish this computer to join, and then click **OK**.
