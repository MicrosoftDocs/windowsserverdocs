# Join a Computer to a Domain

For Active Directory Federation Services \(AD FS\) to function, each computer that functions as a federation server must be joined to a domain. federation server proxies may be joined to a domain, but this is not a requirement.

You do not have to join a Web server to a domain if the Web server is hosting claims\-aware applications only.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure.  Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).

### To join a computer to a domain

1.  On the **Start** screen, type **Control Panel**, and then press ENTER.

2.  Navigate to **System and Security**, and then click **System**.

3.  Under **Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings**, click **Change settings**.

4.  On the **Computer Name** tab, click **Change**.

5.  Under **Member of**, click **Domain**, type the name of the domain that you wish this computer to join, and then click **OK**.

6.  Click **OK**, and then restart the computer.
