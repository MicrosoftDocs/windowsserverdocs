# Verify That a Federation Server Is Operational


You can use the following procedures to verify that a federation server is operational; that is, that any client on the same network can reach a new federation server.

Membership in **Users**, **Backup Operators**, **Power Users**, **Administrators** or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure.  Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).

### Procedure 1: To verify that a federation server is operational

1.  To verify that Internet Information Services \(IIS\) is configured correctly on the federation server, log on to a client computer that is located in the same forest as the federation server.

2.  Open a browser window, in the address bar type the federation server's DNS host name, and then append /adfs/fs/federationserverservice.asmx to it for the new federation server, for example:

    **https://fs1.fabrikam.com/adfs/fs/federationserverservice.asmx**

3.  Press ENTER, and then complete the next procedure on the federation server computer. If you see the message **There is a problem with this website's security certificate**, click **Continue to this website**.

    The expected output is a display of XML with the service description document. If this page appears, IIS on the federation server is operational and serving pages successfully.

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure.  Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).

### Procedure 2: To verify that a federation server is operational

1.  Log on to the new federation server as an administrator.

2.  On the **Start** screen, type **Event Viewer**, and then press ENTER.

3.  In the details pane, double\-click **Applications and Services Logs**, double\-click **AD FS Eventing**, and then click **Admin**.

4.  In the **Event ID** column, look for event ID 100. If the federation server is configured properly, you see a new event—in the Application log of Event Viewer—with the event ID 100. This event verifies that the federation server was able to successfully communicate with the Federation Service.
