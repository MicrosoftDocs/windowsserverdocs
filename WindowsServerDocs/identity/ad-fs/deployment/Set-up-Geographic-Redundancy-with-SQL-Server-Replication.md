# Setup Geographic Redundancy with SQL Server Replication


> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to create an AD FS farm and use SQL Server to store your configuration data, you can use SQL Server 2008 or higher.

If you are using SQL Server as your AD FS configuration database, you can set up geo\-redundancy for your AD FS farm using SQL Server replication. Geo\-redundancy replicates data between two geographically distant sites so that applications can switch from one site to another. This way, in case of the failure of one site, you can still have all the configuration data available at the second site. For more information, see the "SQL Server geographic redundancy section" in [Federation Server Farm Using SQL Server](../design/Federation-Server-Farm-Using-SQL-Server.md).

## Prerequisites
Install and configure a SQL server farm. For more information, see [https://technet.microsoft.com/evalcenter/hh225126.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/). On the initial SQL Server, make sure that the SQL Server Agent service is running and set to automatic start.

## Create the second \(replica\) SQL Server for geo\-redundancy

1. Install SQL Server \(for more information, see [https://technet.microsoft.com/evalcenter/hh225126.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/). Copy the resulting CreateDB.sql and SetPermissions.sql script files to the replica SQL server.

2. Ensure SQL Server Agent service is running and set to automatic start

3. Run **Export\-AdfsDeploymentSQLScript** on the primary AD FS node to create CreateDB.sql and SetPermissions.sql files.  For example:`PS:\>Export-AdfsDeploymentSQLScript -DestinationFolder . –ServiceAccountName CONTOSO\gmsa1$`.
   ![Screenshot that shows how to run the Export-AdfsDeploymentSQLScript on the primary AD FS node.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql2.png)

4. Copy the scripts to your secondary server.  Open the CreateDB.sql script in **SQL Management Studio** and click **Execute**.
   ![Screenshot that shows the open the CreateDB.sql script in SQL Management Studio.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql4.png)

5. Open the SetPermissions.sql script in **SQL Management Studio** and click **Execute**.
   ![Screenshot that shows the open the SetPermissions.sql script in SQL Management Studio.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql6.png)



> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the following from the command line.
>
>    `c:\>sqlcmd –i CreateDB.sql`
>
>    `c:\>sqlcmd –i SetPermissions.sql`

## Create subscription settings on the replica SQL Server
Make sure that you created the publisher settings on the initial SQL Server as described above and then complete the following procedure:

1. On the replica SQL Server, from SQL Server Management studio, under **Replication**, right click **Local Subscriptions** and choose **New Subscription...**.
   ![Screenshot that shows where to select New Subscription.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql24.png) </br>

2. On the **New Subscription Wizard** page, click **Next**.
   ![Screenshot that shows the New Subscription Wizard screen.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql25.png) </br>

3. On the **Publication** page, select the publisher from the drop-down.  Expand **AdfsConfigurationV3** and select the name of the publication created above and click **Next**.
   ![Screenshot that shows where to expand AdfsConfigurationV3 and select the name of the name of the publication that you created.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql26.png) </br>

4. On the **Merge Agent Location** page, select **Run each agent at its Subscriber \(pull subscriptions\)** \(the default\) and click **Next**.
   ![Screenshot that shows the Run each agent at its Subscriber (pull subscriptions) option.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql27.png) </br> This, along with Subscription Type below, determines the conflict resolution logic. \(For more information, see [Detect and Resolve Merge Replication Conflicts](/sql/relational-databases/replication/merge/advanced-merge-replication-conflict-detection-and-resolution). </br>

5. On the **Subscribers** page, select **AdfsConfigurationV3** as the subscriber database and click **Next**.
   ![Screenshot that shows the Subscribers screen.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql28.png) </br>

6. On the **Merge Agent Security** page, click **...** and enter the username and password of a domain account \(not a GMSA\) created for the SQL agent by using the ellipses box and click **Next**.
   ![Screenshot that shows the Merge Agent Security screen.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql30.png) </br>

7. On **Synchronization Schedule**, choose **Run Continuously** and click **Next**.
   ![Screenshot that shows where to select Run continuously.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql31.png) </br>

8. On **Initialize Subscriptions**, click **Next**.
   ![Screenshot that shows the Initialize Subscriptions screen.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql32.png) </br>

9. On **Subscription Type**, choose **Client** and click **Next**.

   Implications of this are documented [here](/sql/relational-databases/replication/merge/advanced-merge-replication-conflict-detection-and-resolution) and [here](/sql/relational-databases/replication/subscribe-to-publications).  Essentially, we take the simple "first to publisher wins" conflict resolution and we do not need to republish to other subscribers.
   ![Screenshot that shows the Subscription Type screen.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql33.png) </br>

10. On the **Wizard Actions** page, ensure **Create the subscription** is checked and click **Next**.
    ![Screenshot that shows where verify that the Create the subscription option is selected.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql34.png) </br>

11. On the **Complete the Wizard** page, click **Finish**.
    ![Screenshot that shows the Complete the Wizard screen.](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql35.png) </br>

12. Once the subscription has finished the creation process, you should see success. Click **Close**.
    ![Set up Geographic Redundancy](media/Set-up-Geographic-Redundancy-with-SQL-Server-Replication/sql36.png) </br>

## Verify the process of initialization and replication

1.  On the primary SQL server, right\-click the **Replication** node and click **Launch Replication Monitor**.

2.  In **Replication Monitor**, click the publication.

3.  On the **All Subscriptions** tab, right click and **View Details**.

    You should be able to see many entries under **Actions** for the initial replication.

4.  Additionally, you can look under the **SQL Server Agent\\Jobs** node to see the job\(s\) scheduled to execute the operations of the publication\/subscription.  Only local jobs are shown, so make sure to check on the publisher and the subscriber for troubleshooting.  Right\-click a job and select **View History** to view execution history and results.

## <a name="sqlagent"></a>Configure SQL login for the domain account CONTOSO\\sqlagent

1.  Create a new login on the primary and replica SQL Server called CONTOSO\\sqlagent \(the name of the new domain user created and configured on the **Agent Security** page in the procedures above.\)

2.  In SQL Server, right\-click the login you created, and select Properties, then under the **User Mapping** tab, map this login to **AdfsConfiguration** and **AdfsArtifact** databases with public and db\_genevaservice roles. Also map this login to distribution database and add db\_owner role for both distribution and adfsconfiguration tables.  Do this as applicable on both primary and replica SQL server. For more information, see [Replication Agent Security Model](/sql/relational-databases/replication/security/replication-agent-security-model).

3.  Give the corresponding domain account read and write permissions on the share configured as distributor.  Make sure that you set read and write permissions both on the share permissions and the local file permissions.

## Configure AD FS node\(s\) to point to the SQL Server replica farm
Now that you have set up geo redundancy, the AD FS farm nodes can be configured to point to your replica SQL Server farm using the standard AD FS "join" farm capabilities, either from the AD FS Configuration Wizard UI or using Windows PowerShell.

If you use the AD FS Configuration Wizard UI, select **Add a federation server to a federation server farm**. **Do NOT** select **Create the first federation server in a federation server farm**.

If you use Windows PowerShell, run **Add\-AdfsFarmNode**. **Do NOT** run **Install\-AdfsFarm**.

When prompted, provide the host and instance name of the replica SQL Server, **NOT** the initial SQL server.
