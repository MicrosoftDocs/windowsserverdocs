# Migrate the AD FS web agent

To migrate the AD FS 1.1 Windows token-based agent or the AD FS 1.1 claims-aware agent that is installed with Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008 to Windows Server 2012, perform an in-place upgrade of the operating system of the computer that hosts either agent to Windows Server 2012. For more information, see [Installing Windows Server 2012](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/jj134246(v=ws.11)). No further configuration is required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The migrated AD FS 1.1 Windows token-based agent functions only with an AD FS 1.1 federation service that is installed with Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008. For more information, see [Interoperating with AD FS 1.x](Interoperating-with-AD-FS-1.x.md).
