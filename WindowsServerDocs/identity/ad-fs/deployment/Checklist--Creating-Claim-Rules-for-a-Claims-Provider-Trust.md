|Task|Reference|
|--------|-------------|
|Review concepts about claims, claim rules, claim rule sets, and claim rule templates and how they are associated with federated trusts.|![Icon for the The Role of Claims link.](media/faa393df-4856-4431-9eda-4f4e5be72a90.gif)[The Role of Claims](../../ad-fs/technical-reference/The-Role-of-Claims.md)<p>![Icon for the The Role of Claim Rules link.](media/faa393df-4856-4431-9eda-4f4e5be72a90.gif)[The Role of Claim Rules](../../ad-fs/technical-reference/The-Role-of-Claim-Rules.md)|
|Review concepts about how a claim flows through all the stages in the claims issuance pipeline and how rules are processed by the claims issuance engine.|![Icon for the The Role of the Claims Pipeline link.](media/faa393df-4856-4431-9eda-4f4e5be72a90.gif)[The Role of the Claims Pipeline](../../ad-fs/technical-reference/The-Role-of-the-Claims-Pipeline.md)<p>![Icon for the The Role of the Claims Engine link.](media/faa393df-4856-4431-9eda-4f4e5be72a90.gif)[The Role of the Claims Engine](../../ad-fs/technical-reference/The-Role-of-the-Claims-Engine.md)|
|To effectively plan and implement the output claims that will be issued over this claims provider trust, determine whether one or more claim rules are needed and which claim rules you should use with this claims provider trust.|![Icon for the Determine the Type of Claim Rule Template to Use link.](media/faa393df-4856-4431-9eda-4f4e5be72a90.gif)[Determine the Type of Claim Rule Template to Use](../../ad-fs/technical-reference/Determine-the-Type-of-Claim-Rule-Template-to-Use.md)|
|Review concepts about when to create one claim rule over another and how you can use the claim rule language to provide more complex logic than standard rules in order to provide a desired result in the ideal output claim set.|![Icon for the When to Use a Pass Through or Filter Claim Rule link.](media/faa393df-4856-4431-9eda-4f4e5be72a90.gif)[When to Use a Pass Through or Filter Claim Rule](../../ad-fs/technical-reference/When-to-Use-a-Pass-Through-or-Filter-Claim-Rule.md)<p>![Icon for the When to Use a Transform Claim Rule link.](media/faa393df-4856-4431-9eda-4f4e5be72a90.gif)[When to Use a Transform Claim Rule](../../ad-fs/technical-reference/When-to-Use-a-Transform-Claim-Rule.md)<p>![Icon for the When to Use a Send LDAP Attributes as Claims Rule link.](media/faa393df-4856-4431-9eda-4f4e5be72a90.gif)[When to Use a Send LDAP Attributes as Claims Rule](../../ad-fs/technical-reference/When-to-Use-a-Send-LDAP-Attributes-as-Claims-Rule.md)<p>![Icon for the When to Use a Send Group Membership as a Claim Rule link.](media/faa393df-4856-4431-9eda-4f4e5be72a90.gif)[When to Use a Send Group Membership as a Claim Rule](../../ad-fs/technical-reference/When-to-Use-a-Send-Group-Membership-as-a-Claim-Rule.md)<p>![Icon for the When to Use a Custom Claim Rule link.](media/faa393df-4856-4431-9eda-4f4e5be72a90.gif)[When to Use a Custom Claim Rule](../../ad-fs/technical-reference/When-to-Use-a-Custom-Claim-Rule.md)<p>![Icon for the The Role of the Claim Rule Language link.](media/faa393df-4856-4431-9eda-4f4e5be72a90.gif)[The Role of the Claim Rule Language](../../ad-fs/technical-reference/The-Role-of-the-Claim-Rule-Language.md)|
|A claim description must be created if one does not already exist that will fulfill the needs of your organization.
