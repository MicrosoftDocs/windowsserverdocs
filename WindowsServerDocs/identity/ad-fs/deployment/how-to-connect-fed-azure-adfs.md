# Deploy Active Directory Federation Services in Azure

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) provides simplified, secured identity federation and web single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. Users federated with Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365 can authenticate using on-premises credentials to access all cloud resources. As a result, your deployment must have a highly available AD FS infrastructure to ensure access to resources both on-premises and in the cloud.

Deploying AD FS in Azure can help achieve high availability without too much effort. There are several advantages of deploying AD FS in Azure:

- The power of Azure availability sets gives you a highly available infrastructure.
- Deployments are easy to scale. If you need more performance, you can easily migrate to more powerful machines using a simplified deployment process in Azure.
- Azure geo redundancy ensures your infrastructure is highly available across the globe.
- The Azure portal makes your infrastructure easier to manage with highly simplified management options.

## Design principles

The following diagram shows the recommended basic topology for deploying AD FS infrastructure in Azure.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/deployment.png" alt-text="A diagram that shows the recommended basic topology for deploying AD FS infrastructure in Azure.":::

We recommend your network topology follows these general principles:

- Deploy AD FS on separate servers to avoid affecting the performance of your domain controllers.
- You must deploy web application proxy (WAP) servers so that users can reach the AD FS when they aren't on the company network.
- You should set up the web application proxy servers in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) and only allow TCP/443 access between the DMZ and internal subnet.
- To ensure high availability of AD FS and web application proxy servers, we recommend using an internal load balancer for AD FS servers and Azure Load Balancer for web application proxy servers.
- To provide redundancy to your AD FS deployment, we recommend that you group two or more virtual machines (VMs) in an availability set for similar workloads. This configuration ensures that during either a planned or unplanned maintenance event, at least one VM is available.
- You should deploy web application proxy servers in a separate DMZ network. You can divide one virtual network into two subnets and then deploy the web application proxy servers in an isolated subnet. You can configure the network security group settings for each subnet and allow only required communication between the two subnets.

## Deploy the network

When creating a network, you can either create two subnets in the same virtual network or create two different virtual networks. We recommend using the single-network approach, as creating two separate virtual networks also requires creating two separate virtual network gateways for communication purposes.

### Create a virtual network

To create a virtual network:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with your Azure account.

1. In the portal, search for and select **Virtual networks**.

1. On the **Virtual networks** page, select **+ Create**.

1. In **Create virtual network**, go to the **Basics** tab and configure the following settings:

    - Configure the following settings under **Project details**:
  
      - For **Subscription**, select the name of your subscription.

      - For **Resource group**, either select the name of an existing resource group or select **Create new** to make a new one.

    - Configure the following settings for **Instance details**:

      - For **Virtual network name**, enter a name for your virtual network.

      - For **Region**, select the region you want to create your virtual network in.

1. Select **Next**.

1. In the **Security** tab, enable any security service you want to use, then select **Next**.

1. On the **IP addresses** tab, select the name of the subnet you want to edit. For this example, we're editing the **default** subnet that the service automatically creates.

1. On the **Edit subnet** page, rename the subnet to **INT**.

1. Enter the **IP address** and **Subnet size** information for your subnet to define an **IP address space**.

1. For **Network security group**, select **Create new**.

1. For this example, enter the name **NSG_INT** and select **OK**, then select **Save**. You now have your first subnet.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/create-subnet-with-int-nsg.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to edit a subnet and add an internal network security group.":::

1. To create your second subnet, select **+ Add a subnet**.

1. On the **Add a subnet** page, enter **DMZ** for the second subnet name, then enter information about your subnet into the empty fields to define an **IP address space**.

1. For **Network security group**, select **Create new**.

1. Enter the name **NSG_DMZ**, select **OK**, then select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/create-subnet-with-dmz-nsg.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to add a new subnet that includes a network security group.":::

1. Select **Review + create**, then select **Create**.

You now have a virtual network that includes two subnets, each with an associated network security group.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/subnets-with-nsgs.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the new subnets and their network security groups.":::

### Secure the virtual network

A Network security group (NSG) contains a list of Access Control List (ACL) rules that allow or deny network traffic to your VM instances in a virtual network. You can associate NSGs with either subnets or individual VM instances within that subnet. When an NSG is associated with a subnet, the ACL rules apply to all the VM instances in that subnet.

The NSGs associated with your subnets automatically include some default inbound and outbound rules. You can't delete default security rules, but you can override them with rules that have a higher priority. And, you can add more inbound and outbound rules according to the level of security you want.

Now, add a couple of rules to each of our two security groups. For the first example, let's add an inbound security rule to the **NSG_INT** security group.

1. On your virtual network's **Subnets** page, select **NSG_INT**.

1. On the left, select **Inbound security rules**, then select **+ Add**.

1. In **Add inbound security rule**, configure the rule with the following information:

    - For **Source**, enter **10.0.1.0/24**.

    - For the **Source port ranges**, either leave it blank if you don't want to allow traffic or select an asterisk (*) to allow traffic on any port.

    - For **Destination**, enter **10.0.0.0/24**.

    - For **Service**, select **HTTPS**. The service automatically fills the information fields for **Destination port ranges** and **Protocol** depending on which service you choose.

    - For **Action**, select **Allow**.

    - For **Priority**, enter **1010**.

    - For **Name**, enter **AllowHTTPSFromDMZ**.

    - For **Description**, enter **Allow the HTTPS communication from DMZ.**

1. After you're finished, select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/nsg-add-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to add an inbound security rule.":::
   The new inbound security rule is now added to the top of the list of rules for **NSG_INT**.

1. Repeat these steps with the values shown in the following table. In addition to the new rule you created, you must add the following extra rules in the priority order listed to help secure your internal and DMZ subnet.

    | NSG | Type of rule | Source | Destination | Service | Action | Priority | Name | Description |
    |:--- |:--- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
    | NSG_INT | Outbound | Any | Service Tag/Internet | Custom (80/Any) | Deny | 100 | DenyInternetOutbound | No access to internet. |
    | NSG_DMZ | Inbound | Any | Any | Custom (Asterisk (*)/Any) | Allow | 1010 | AllowHTTPSFromInternet | Allow HTTPS from internet to the DMZ. |
    | NSG_DMZ | Outbound | Any | Service Tag/Internet | Custom (80/Any) | Deny | 100 | DenyInternetOutbound | Anything except HTTPS to internet is blocked. |

1. After you finish entering the values for each new rule, select **Add** and proceed to the next until two new security rules are added for each NSG.

After configuration, the **NSG** pages should look like the following screenshot:

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/nsgs-with-security-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing your NSGs after you added security rules.":::

> [!NOTE]
> If the virtual network requires client user certificate authentication, such as clientTLS authentication using X.509 user certificates, you must enable TCP port 49443 for inbound access.

### Create connection to on-premises

You need a connection to on-premises to deploy the DC in Azure. You can connect your on-premises infrastructure to your Azure infrastructure using one of the following options:

- Point-to-site
- Virtual Network site-to-site
- ExpressRoute

We recommend you use ExpressRoute if your organization doesn't require point-to-site or Virtual Network site-to-site connections. ExpressRoute lets you create private connections between Azure datacenters and infrastructure that's on your premises or in a colocation environment. ExpressRoute connections also don't connect to the public internet, which makes them more reliable, faster, and more secure. To learn more about ExpressRoute and the various connectivity options using ExpressRoute, read [ExpressRoute technical overview](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction).

## Create availability sets

For each role (DC/AD FS and WAP), create availability sets that contain at least two machines each. This configuration helps achieve higher availability for each role. While creating the availability sets, you must decide which of the following domains you want to use:

- In a fault domain, VMs share the same power source and physical network switch. We recommend a minimum of two fault domains. The default value is **2** and you can leave it as-is for this deployment.

- In an update domain, machines restart together during an update. We recommend a minimum of two update domains. The default value is **5**, and you can leave it as-is for this deployment.

To create availability sets:

1. Search for and select **Availability sets** in the Azure portal, then select **+ Create**.

1. In **Create availability set**, go to the **Basics** tab and enter the following information:

    - Under **Project details**:

      - For **Subscription**, select the name of your subscription.

      - For **Resource group**, either select an existing resource group or **Create new** to make a new one.

    - Under **Instance details**:

      - For **Name**, enter the name for your availability set. For this example, enter **contosodcset**.

      - For **Region**, select the region you want to use.

      - For **Fault domains**, leave it on the default value of **2**.

      - For **Update domains**, leave it at the default value of **5**.

      - For **Use managed disks**, select **No (Classic)** for this example.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/create-availability-set.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to create availability sets.":::

1. After you're done, select **Review + create**, then **Create**.

1. Repeat the previous steps to create a second availability set with the name **contososac2**.

## Deploy virtual machines

The next step is to deploy VMs that host the different roles in your infrastructure. We recommend a minimum of two machines in each availability set. For this example, we create four VMs for the basic deployment.

To create VMs:

1. Search for and select **Virtual machines** in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Virtual machines** page, select **+ Create**, then choose **Azure virtual machine**.

1. In **Create a virtual machine**, go to the **Basics** tab and enter the following information:

    - Under **Project details**:

      - For **Subscription**, select the name of your subscription.

      - For **Resource group**, either select an existing resource group or **Create new** to make a new one.

    - Under **Instance details**:

      - For **Virtual machine name**, enter a name for your VM. For the first machine in this example, enter **contosodc1**.

      - For **Region**, select the region you want to use.

      - For **Availability options**, select **Availability set**.

      - For **Availability set**, select **contosodcset**

      - For **Security type**, select **Standard**.

      - For **Subscription**, select the name of your subscription.

      - For **Image**, select the image you want to use, then select **Configure VM generation** and select **Gen 1**.

    - Under **Administrator account**:

      - For **Authentication type**, select **SSH public key**.

      - For **Username**, enter a user name to use for the account.

      - For **Key pair name**, enter a key pair name to use for the account.

    - For anything not specified, you can leave the default values.

1. When you're finished, select **Next: Disks**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/create-vm-basics-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the first steps in how to create a virtual machine.":::

1. In the **Networking** tab, enter the following information:
  
   - For **virtual network**, select the name of the virtual network that contains the subnets you created in the previous section.
  
   - For **Subnet**, select your **INT** subnet.
  
   - For **NIC network security group**, select **None**.

   - For anything not specified, you can leave the defaults.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/create-vm-networking-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Networking tab for how to create a virtual machine.":::

1. After you've made all your choices, select **Review + create**, then select **Create**.

Repeat these steps using the information in this table to create the three remaining VMs:

| Virtual machine name | Subnet | Availability options | Availability set | Storage account |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| contosodc2 | INT | Availability set | contosodcset | contososac2 |
| contosowap1 | DMZ | Availability set | contosowapset | contososac1 |
| contosowap2 | DMZ | Availability set | contosowapset | contososac2 |

The settings don't specify NSG because Azure lets you use NSG at the subnet level. You can control machine network traffic by using the individual NSG associated with either the subnet or the network interface card (NIC) object. For more information, see [What is a network security group (NSG)](/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic).

If you're managing the DNS, we recommend you use a static IP address. You can use Azure DNS and refer to the new machines by their Azure FQDNs in the DNS records for your domain. For more information, see [Change a private IP address to static](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/virtual-networks-static-private-ip-arm-pportal#change-private-ip-address-to-static).

Your **Virtual machines** page should show all four VMs after the deployment completes.

## Configure the DC and AD FS servers

To authenticate any incoming request, AD FS needs to contact the DC. To save the costly trip from Azure to on-premises DC for authentication, we recommend you deploy a replica of the DC in Azure. In order to attain high availability, it's better to create an availability set of at least two DCs.

| Domain controller | Role | Storage account |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| contosodc1 |Replica |contososac1 |
| contosodc2 |Replica |contososac2 |

We recommend you do the following things:

- Promote the two servers as replica DCs with DNS

- Configure the AD FS servers by installing the AD FS role using the server manager.

## Create and deploy the internal load balancer (ILB)

To create and deploy an ILB:

1. Search for and select **Load Balancers** in the Azure portal and choose **+ Create**.

1. In **Create load balancer**, enter or select this information in the **Basics** tab:

      - When you're finished, select **Save**.

    - When you're done, select **Save** to save the inbound rule.

1. Select **Save** to save the inbound rule.
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/add-inbound-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to add load balancing rules.":::

1. Select **Review + create**, then select **Create**.

After you select **Create** and the ILB deploys, you can see it in the list of load balancers, as shown in the following screenshot.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/list-of-load-balancers.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the new load balancer you just created.":::

### Update the DNS server with ILB

Using your internal DNS server, create an A record for the ILB. This setting ensures that all data transmitted to fs.contoso.com ends up at the ILB using the appropriate route. The A record should be for the federation service with the IP address pointing to the IP address of the ILB. For example, if the ILB IP address is 10.3.0.8 and the federation service installed is fs.contoso.com, create an A record for fs.contoso.com pointing to 10.3.0.8.

> [!WARNING]
> If you're using the Windows Internal Database (WID) for your AD FS database, set this value to temporarily point to your primary AD FS server. If you don't make this temporary setting change, the web application proxy fails enrollment. After you successfully enroll all web application proxy servers, change this DNS entry to point to the load balancer.

> [!NOTE]
> If your deployment is also using IPv6, create a corresponding AAAA record.

### Configure the web application proxy servers to reach AD FS servers

To ensure that web application proxy servers are able to reach the AD FS servers behind the ILB, create a record in the %systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file for the ILB. The distinguished name (DN) should be the federation service name, such as fs.contoso.com. And the IP entry should be the ILB's IP address, which in this example is 10.3.0.8.

> [!WARNING]
> If you're using the Windows Internal Database (WID) for your AD FS database, set this value to temporarily point to your primary AD FS server. If you don't, the web application proxy fails enrollment. After you successfully enroll all web application proxy servers, change this DNS entry to point to the load balancer.

### Install the web application proxy role

After you ensure that web application proxy servers are able to reach the AD FS servers behind ILB, you can next install the web application proxy servers. Web application proxy servers don't need to be joined to the domain. Install the web application proxy roles on the two web application proxy servers by selecting the **Remote Access** role. The server manager guides you to complete the WAP installation.

For more information on how to deploy WAP, see [Install and Configure the web application proxy Server](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn383662(v=ws.11)).

## Test the AD FS sign-in

The easiest way to test AD FS is by using the IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx page. To do that, you must enable the IdpInitiatedSignOn on the AD FS properties.

To check if you have the IdpInitiatedSignOn property enabled:

1. In PowerShell, run the following cmdlet on the AD FS server to set it to enabled.

   ```powershell
   Set-AdfsProperties -EnableIdPInitiatedSignOnPage $true
   ```

1. From any external machine, access `https:\//adfs-server.contoso.com/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignon.aspx`.

1. You should see the following AD FS page:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-connect-fed-azure-adfs/test1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of test sign-in page.":::

1. Try to sign in. If you sign in successfully, you should see a message appear, as shown in the following screenshot.
