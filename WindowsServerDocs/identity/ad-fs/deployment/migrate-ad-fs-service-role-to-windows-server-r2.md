# Migrate Active Directory Federation Services Role Services to Windows Server 2012 R2
 This document provides instructions to migrate the following role services to Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) that is installed with Windows Server 2012 R2:

-   AD FS 2.0 federation server installed on Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2

-   AD FS federation server installed on Windows Server 2012

## Supported migration scenarios
 The migration instructions in this guide consist of the following tasks:

- Exporting the AD FS 2.0 configuration data from your server that is running Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows Server 2012

- Performing an in-place upgrade of the operating system of this server from Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2012 to Windows Server 2012 R2.

- Recreating the original AD FS configuration and restoring the remaining AD FS service settings on this server, which is now running the AD FS server role that is installed with Windows Server 2012 R2.

  This guide does not include instructions to migrate a server that is running multiple roles. If your server is running multiple roles, we recommend that you design a custom migration process specific to your server environment, based on the information provided in other role migration guides. Migration guides for additional roles are available on the [Windows Server Migration Portal](../../../get-started/migrate-roles-and-features.md).

### Supported operating systems
 Destination server operating system:

 Windows Server 2012 R2 (Server Core and full installation options)
