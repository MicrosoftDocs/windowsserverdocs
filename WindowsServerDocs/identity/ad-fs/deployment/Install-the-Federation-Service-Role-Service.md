# Install the Federation Service Role Service

Now that you have properly configured a computer with the prerequisite applications and certificates, you are ready to install the Federation Service role service of Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). When you install the Federation Service on a computer, that computer becomes a federation server.

> [!NOTE]
> For the Federated Web Single-Sign-On (SSO) design, you must have at least one federation server in the account partner organization and at least one federation server in the resource partner organization. For more information, see [Where to Place a Federation Server](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dd807127(v=ws.11)).

You can use the following procedure to install the Federation Service role service of AD FS on a computer that will become the first federation server or on a computer that will become a federation server for an existing federation server farm.

## Prerequisites
Verify that an SSL certificate with the private key has already been installed or imported into the local certificate store (Personal store) before you start this procedure. If you will be using a token-signing certificate that is issued by a certification authority (CA), verify that a token-signing certificate with the private key has already been installed or imported into the local certificate store (Personal store) before you start this procedure. As an alternative, you can create a self-signed, token-signing certificate using the Add Roles Wizard, as described in this procedure. For more information about token-signing certificates, see [Certificate Requirements for Federation Servers](../design/certificate-requirements-for-federation-servers.md).

Membership in **Administrators**, or equivalent, on the local computer is the minimum required to complete this procedure. Review details about using the appropriate accounts and group memberships at [Local and Domain Default Groups](/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.10/dd728026(v=ws.10)).
