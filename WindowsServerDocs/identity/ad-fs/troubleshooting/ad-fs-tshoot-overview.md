# Troubleshoot AD FS

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) has many moving pieces, touches many different things, and has many different dependencies. This complexity can give rise to various issues. This article helps to get you started on troubleshooting these issues. It introduces you to the common areas where you should focus, how to enable features for more information, and the various tools to track down problems.

## What to check first

Before you dive into in-depth troubleshooting, check these things first:

- **Domain Name System (DNS) configuration**: Can you resolve the name of the federation service? This connection should resolve to either the load balancer's IP address or the IP address of one of the AD FS servers in your farm. For more information, see [AD FS troubleshooting: DNS](ad-fs-tshoot-dns.md).
- **AD FS endpoints**: Can you browse to the AD FS endpoints? Browsing to this endpoint can determine whether or not your AD FS web server is responding to requests. If you can get to this file, you know that AD FS is servicing requests over 443. For more information, see [AD FS troubleshooting: AD FS metadata endpoints](ad-fs-tshoot-endpoints.md).
- **Identity Provider (IdP)-initiated sign-in**: Can you sign in and authenticate via the IdP-initiated sign-in page? Ensure that this page is enabled because it's disabled by default. Use `Set-AdfsProperties -EnableIdPInitiatedSignOn $true` to enable the page. If you can sign in and authenticate, you know that AD FS is working in this area. For more information, see [AD FS troubleshooting: IdP-initiated sign-in](ad-fs-tshoot-initiatedsignon.md).
