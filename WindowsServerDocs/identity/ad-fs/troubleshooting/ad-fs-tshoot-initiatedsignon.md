# AD FS Troubleshooting - Idp-Initiated Sign On
The AD FS sign-on page can be used to test whether or not authentication is working.  This is done by navigating to the page and signing in.  Also, we can use the sign-in page to verify that all SAML 2.0 relying parties are listed.

## Enable the Idp-Initiated Sign on page
By default, AD FS in Windows 2016 does not have the sign on page enabled.  In order to enable it you can use the PowerShell command Set-AdfsProperties.  Use the following procedure to enable the page:

1.  Open Windows PowerShell
2.  Enter:  `Get-AdfsProperties` and hit enter
3.  Verify that **EnableIdpInitiatedSignonPage** is set to false

4.  In PowerShell, enter:  `Set-AdfsProperties -EnableIdpInitiatedSignonPage $true`
5.  You will not see a confirmation so enter Get-AdfsProperties again and verify that **EnableIdpInitatedSignonPage** is set to true.

## Test authentication
Use the following procedure to test AD FS authentication with the Idp-Initiated Sign on page.

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the Idp sign on page.  Example:  https://sts.contoso.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.htm
2.  You should be prompted to sign-in.  Enter your credentials.

3.  If this was successful you should be signed in.


## Test authentication using a seamless logon experience
You can test the seamless logon experience by making sure that the URL for your AD FS servers are added the local intranet zone of your internet options.  Use the following procedure:

1.  On a Windows 10 client, click start and type internet options and select internet options.
2.   Click the security tab, click on local intranet, and click the sites button.
