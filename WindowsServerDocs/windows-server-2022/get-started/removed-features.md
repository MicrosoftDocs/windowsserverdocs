# Features removed from Windows Server 2022

>Applies to: Windows Server 2022

## Semi-Annual Channel

With Windows Server 2022 there is one primary release channel available, the Long-Term Servicing Channel. The Semi-Annual Channel in previous versions of Windows Server 2019 focused on containers and microservices, and that innovation will continue with [Azure Stack HCI](/azure-stack/hci/).

With the Long-Term Servicing Channel, a new major version of Windows Server is released every 2-3 years. Users are entitled to five years of mainstream support and five years of extended support. This channel provides systems with a long servicing option and functional stability, and can be installed with Server Core or Server with Desktop Experience installation options. The Long-Term Servicing Channel will continue to receive security and non-security updates, but it will not receive the new features and functionality.
