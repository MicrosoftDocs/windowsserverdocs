# Windows Server release information

Microsoft has updated its servicing model. The Semi-Annual Channel is a twice-per-year feature update release with 18-month servicing timelines for each release. This page is designed to help you determine the end of support date for the Semi-Annual Channel releases.

The Semi-Annual Channel provides opportunity for customers who are innovating quickly to take advantage of new operating system capabilities at a faster pace, both in applications - particularly those built on containers and microservices - and in the software-defined hybrid datacenter. For more information see the [Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel overview](semi-annual-channel-overview.md). Customers also have the option to continue using the Long-Term Servicing Channel releases, which continue to be released every 2-3 years. Each Long-Term Servicing Channel release is supported for 5 years of mainstream support and 5 years of extended support.
