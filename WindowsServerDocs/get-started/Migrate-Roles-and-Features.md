# Migrating Roles and Features in Windows Server

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

This page contains links to information and tools that help guide you through the process of migrating roles and features to Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2012. Many roles and features can be migrated by using Windows Server Migration Tools, a set of five Windows PowerShell cmdlets that was introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 for easily migrating role and feature elements and data.

The migration guides support migrations of specified roles and features from one server to another (not in-place upgrades). Unless otherwise noted in the guides, migrations are supported between physical and virtual computers, and between full installation options of Windows Server and servers that are running the Server Core installation option. Â 

## Before you begin

Before you begin migrating roles and features, verify that both source and destination servers are running the most current service packs that are available for their operating systems.
An e-book of Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2012 migration guides is now available. For more information, and to download the e-book, see the [E-Book Gallery for Microsoft Technologies](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/11608.e-book-gallery-for-microsoft-technologies.aspx#MigrateRoles). 

>[!NOTE]
>Whenever you migrate or upgrade to any version of Windows Server, you should review and understand the [support lifecycle policy](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle) and timeframe for that version and plan accordingly. You can [search for the lifecycle information](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle) for the particular Windows Server release that you are interested in.
