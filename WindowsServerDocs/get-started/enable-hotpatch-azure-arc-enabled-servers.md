# Enable Hotpatch for Azure Arc-enabled servers (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Arc-enabled Hotpatch is currently in PREVIEW.

Hotpatch allows you to update your Windows Server installation without requiring your users to restart after installation. This feature minimizes downtime spent on updates and keeps your users running their workloads uninterrupted. For more information about how Hotpatch works, see [Hotpatch for virtual machines](hotpatch.md).

Windows Server 2025 features the ability to enable Hotpatch for Azure Arc-enabled servers. In order to use Hotpatch on Azure Arc-enabled servers, all you have to do is deploy the Connected Machine agent and enable Windows Server Hotpatch. This article describes how to enable Hotpatching.

## Prerequisites

Before you can enable Hotpatch on Arc-enabled servers for Windows Server 2025, you need the following things:

- A Windows Server deployment that runs one of the following versions of Windows Server 2025:

  - Windows Server 2025 Standard Edition

  - Windows Server 2025 Datacenter Edition

- An Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

- A server that meets [the requirements for enabling Azure Arc on a server](/azure/azure-arc/servers/prerequisites).

- You have Windows Server machine connected to Azure Arc. To learn more about onboarding your machine to Azure Arc, see [Connect Windows Server machines to Azure through Azure Arc Setup](/azure/azure-arc/servers/onboard-windows-server?toc=/windows-server/get-started/toc.json&bc=/windows-server/breadcrumbs/toc.json).

- The virtual machine (VM) you intend to enable Hotpatch on must be a Generation 2 VM running [the Windows Server 2025 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2025?msockid=110e69cfccac69d1320d7d42cd16685d).

## Install Hotpatch preview version for Windows Server 2025

To install the preview version of the Hotpatch for Windows Server 2025 Standard and Datacenter Editions:

1. Run the following command in an elevated command prompt:

   ```cmd
   Reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\DeviceGuard" /v "EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
   ```

1. Restart your computer.

1. After you enable Azure Arc, sign in to the Azure Arc portal and go to **Azure Arc** > **Machines**.

1. Select the name of your machine.

1. Select **Hotpatch (preview)**, then select **Confirm**.

1. Wait about 10 minutes for the changes to apply. If the update stays stuck on the Pending status, run the following cmdlet in PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072;
   Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://aka.ms/azcmagent-windows" -TimeoutSec 30 -OutFile "$env:TEMP\install_windows_azcmagent.ps1";
   & "$env:TEMP\install_windows_azcmagent.ps1";
   ```

1. You should now be prompted to install a Hotpatch update when a Hotpatch is available from Windows Update.
