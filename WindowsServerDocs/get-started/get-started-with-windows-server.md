# Get started with Windows Server

Windows Server is the platform for building an infrastructure of connected applications, networks, and web services, from the workgroup to the data center. It bridges on-premises environments with Azure, adding additional layers of security while helping you modernize your applications and infrastructure.

Once you've checked the system requirements, upgrade options, and other information about Windows Server, you're ready to start down the path of installing the best edition and installation option for your needs.
