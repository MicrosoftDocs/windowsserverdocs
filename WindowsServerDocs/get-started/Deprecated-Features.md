## Features removed from Windows Server 2016

The following features and functionalities have been removed from this release of Windows Server 2016. Applications, code, or usage that depend on these features will not function in this release unless you employ an alternate method.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are moving to Windows Server 2016 from a server release prior to Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012, you should also review [Features Removed or Deprecated in Windows Server 2012 R2](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn303411(v=ws.11)) and [Features Removed or Deprecated in Windows Server 2012](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831568(v=ws.11)).

### Share and Storage Management

The Share and Storage Management snap-in for Microsoft Management Console has been removed. Instead, do any of the following:

-   If the computer you want to manage is running an operating system older than Windows Server 2016, connect to it with Remote Desktop and use the local version of the Share and Storage Management snap-in.

-   On a computer running Windows 8.1 or earlier, use the Share and Storage Management snap-in from RSAT to view the computer you want to manage.

-   Use Hyper-V on a client computer to run a virtual machine running Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1 that has the Share and Storage Management snap-in in RSAT.

### Journal.dll

The Journal.dll is removed from Windows Server 2016. There is no replacement.

### Security Configuration Wizard

The Security Configuration Wizard is removed. Instead, features are secured by default. If you need to control specific security settings, you can use either Group Policy or [Microsoft Security Compliance Manager](/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc936627(v=technet.10)).

### SQM

The opt-in components that manage participation in the Customer Experience Improvement Program have been removed.

### Windows Update

The **wuauclt.exe /detectnow** command has been removed and is no longer supported. To trigger a scan for updates, do either of the following:

- Run these PowerShell commands:
    ````powershell
    $AutoUpdates = New-Object -ComObject "Microsoft.Update.AutoUpdate"
    $AutoUpdates.DetectNow()
    ````

- Alternately, use this VBScript:
    ````vb
    Set automaticUpdates = CreateObject("Microsoft.Update.AutoUpdate")
    automaticUpdates.DetectNow()
    ````

## Features deprecated starting with Windows Server 2016

The following features and functionalities are deprecated starting with this release. Eventually, they will be completely removed from the product, but they are still available in this release, sometimes with certain functionality removed. You should begin planning now to employ alternate methods for any applications, code, or usage that depend on these features.

### Configuration tools

-   **Scregedit.exe** is deprecated. If you have scripts that depend on Scregedit.exe, adjust them to use Reg.exe or Windows PowerShell methods.

-   **Sconfig.exe** is deprecated. Use [Sconfig.cmd](./sconfig-on-ws2016.md) instead.

### NetCfg custom APIs

Installation of PrintProvider, NetClient, and ISDN using NetCfg custom APIs is deprecated.

### Remote management

WinRM.vbs is deprecated. Instead, use functionality in the WinRM provider of Windows PowerShell.
