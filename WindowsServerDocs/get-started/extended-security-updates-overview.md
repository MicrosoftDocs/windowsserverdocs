# Extended Security Updates for Windows Server Overview

The Extended Security Update (ESU) program is a last resort option for customers who need to run certain legacy Microsoft products past the end of support. Windows Server [Long Term Servicing Channel](servicing-channels-comparison.md) (LTSC) has a minimum of ten years of support: five years for mainstream support and five years for extended support, which includes regular security updates.

However, once products reach the end of support, it also means the end of security updates and bulletins. This scenario can cause security or compliance issues and put business applications at risk. Microsoft recommends that you [upgrade to the current version of Windows Server](install-upgrade-migrate.md) for the most advanced security, performance, and innovation.

> [!TIP]
> You can find information on support dates on [Microsoft Lifecycle](/lifecycle/products/).

Versions of Windows Server that have reached or are reaching the end of extended support are:

- Extended support for [Windows Server 2008](/lifecycle/products/windows-server-2008) and [Windows Server 2008 R2](/lifecycle/products/windows-server-2008-r2) ended on January 14, 2020.
- Extended support for [Windows Server 2012](/lifecycle/products/windows-server-2012) and [Windows Server 2012 R2](/lifecycle/products/windows-server-2012-r2) will be ending on October 10, 2023.

## What are Extended Security Updates?

Extended Security Updates for Windows Server include security updates and bulletins rated *critical* and *important*, for a maximum period of time from the end of extended support, depending on the version (see below). They are available free of charge for servers hosted in Azure, and available to purchase for servers not hosted in Azure. Extended Security Updates don't include new features, customer-requested non-security hotfixes, or design change requests. For more information, see [Lifecycle FAQ - Extended Security Updates](/lifecycle/faq/extended-security-updates).

If you haven't already upgraded your servers, the following options will help protect your applications and data during the transition:

- **Migrate the affected existing Windows Server workloads as-is to Azure Virtual Machines (VM)**: this migration to Azure automatically provides Extended Security Updates for the defined period. There's no additional charge for Extended Security Updates on top of an Azure VM's cost, and there's no additional configuration required.

- **Purchase an Extended Security Update subscription for your servers and remain protected until you're ready to upgrade to a newer Windows Server version**: these updates are provided for the defined period. Once the subscription is purchased, you need to obtain a product key and install it on each applicable server. For more information, see [How to get Extended Security Updates](extended-security-updates-deploy.md).

The period of time Extended Security Updates will be provided depends on the version of Windows Server, and where it's hosted:

| Product version | Hosted | ESU duration | ESU end date |
|--|--|--|--|
| Windows Server 2008<br />Windows Server 2008 R2 | Azure* | Four years | January 9, 2024 |
| Windows Server 2008<br />Windows Server 2008 R2 | Not in Azure | Three years | January 10, 2023 |
| Windows Server 2012<br />Windows Server 2012 R2 | Azure* | Three years | October 13, 2026 |
| Windows Server 2012<br />Windows Server 2012 R2 | Not in Azure | Three years | October 13, 2026 |

\* Includes the [Azure Stack portfolio of products](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/azure-stack/) that extend Azure services and capabilities to your environment of choice.

> [!WARNING]
> After the period of Extended Security Updates, we'll stop providing updates. We recommend you update your version of Windows Server to a more recent version as soon as possible.

## Migrate to Azure

You can migrate your servers that are on-premises running a version of Windows Server that has reached or is reaching end of extended support to Azure, where you can continue to run them as virtual machines. In Azure you'll stay compliant, become more secure, and add cloud innovation to your work. The benefits of migrating to Azure include:

- Security updates in Azure.
- Get Windows Server critical and important security updates for a period of time, included at no additional charge.
- No-charge upgrades in Azure.
- Adopt more cloud services as you are ready.
- By migrating SQL Server to Azure VMs, you get three more years of Windows Server critical security updates, included at no additional charge. You could also modernize your SQL Server to [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview).
- Benefit from [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/), which means you can leverage existing Windows Server licenses and SQL Server licenses for cloud savings unique to Azure.

To get started migrating, learn how to [upload a generalized VHD and use it to create new VMs in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/upload-generalized-managed), or use [Shared Image Galleries in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries).

To help you understand how to analyze existing IT resources, assess what you have, and identify the benefits of moving specific services and applications to the cloud or keeping workloads on-premises and upgrading to the latest version of Windows Server, see [Migration Guide for Windows Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872689).

## Migrate or upgrade on-premises

If you need to keep your servers on-premises, you will need to either build new servers with a supported version of Windows Server and migrate your applications and data, or you will need to [upgrade in-place](install-upgrade-migrate.md) to a supported version of Windows Server. Windows Server can typically be upgraded through at least one, and sometimes even two, versions. For example, Windows Server 2012 R2 can be upgraded in-place to Windows Server 2019. However, if you are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2, there is no direct upgrade path to Windows Server 2016 or later. Instead, upgrade first to Windows Server 2012 R2, and then upgrade to Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019. As you upgrade, you still have the option to migrate to Azure, which is covered below. See [supported upgrade paths for Windows Server](supported-upgrade-paths.md) for more information about your on-premises upgrade options.

## Upgrade SQL Server in parallel with your Windows Servers

If you are running a version of SQL Server that has reached or is reaching the end of extended support, you can also benefit from Extended Security Updates for SQL Server. For more information, see [Extended Security Updates for SQL Server and Windows Server](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-server/extended-security-updates).
