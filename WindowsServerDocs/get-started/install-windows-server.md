# Install Windows Server from installation media

Learn how to create a bootable USB drive or DVD that can be used to install Windows Server on your devices. Creating a Windows Server installation media is a crucial step in setting up a new server or upgrade from an existing one. This article aims to guide you on how to create installation media and install Windows Server using either the Server Core or Desktop Experience install options.

## Prerequisites

Setup media for the target version of Windows Server can be obtained from Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Retail, Visual Studio subscription, and the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) channels. Your device must also not be running in Azure. If you want to install Windows Server in Azure, see [Quickstart: Create a Windows virtual machine in the Azure portal](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal). The following are required before installing Windows Server:

- **Hardware**

  - Your device must meet or exceed the minimum hardware requirements. To learn more, see [Hardware requirements for Windows Server](hardware-requirements.md).
  - A minimum of an 8 GB USB flash drive.
  - An optical drive capable of burning a DVD+/-RW dual-layer disk.
  - A dual-layer 8.5 GB DVD.

- **Software**

  - Determine which version of Windows Server is appropriate for your environment. To learn more, see [Comparison of Windows Server editions](editions-comparison.md).
  - Make sure you have a valid product key or subscription license for your product. Product keys and activation methods might vary depending on the distribution channel you received Windows Server media from, such as a Commercial Licensing program, Retail, or OEM.

> [!NOTE]
> For users who desire to install Windows Server in a virtual environment through Windows Hyper-V, the minimum RAM requirements differ. To learn more, see the [Hardware requirements for Windows Server](hardware-requirements.md?tabs=ram&pivots=windows-server-2025#components) components tab.

## Create a bootable USB flash drive

Generally, creating a bootable USB drive can be performed using the [diskpart.exe](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskpart) utility. An alternative to manually preparing your USB drive, users can run the following PowerShell script to make the USB drive bootable. The Windows Server installation ISO file must be mounted before running this script. To mount the ISO file, perform the following steps:

1. Locate your Windows Server installation ISO file.

1. Right-click on your ISO file and select **Mount**.

Mounting the ISO file creates a virtual optical drive, with its own drive letter, where users can migrate the ISO contents to their USB drive.

Once you plug in your USB drive, it should provide you with a drive letter. Once you know the drive letter of both the USB drive and mounted ISO, run one of the following scripts. Each script accounts for three retries before skipping over to the next set of files.

# [Format as NTFS](#tab/format-ntfs)

This script makes your USB drive bootable in NTFS format.

```powershell
# Select USB drive letter
$usbDriveLetter = Read-Host "Enter USB drive letter (Ex: E)"

# Format USB drive
Format-Volume -DriveLetter $usbDriveLetter -FileSystem NTFS -NewFileSystemLabel "WinServerUSB" -Confirm:$false | Out-Null

# Select ISO file mount point
$isoMountPointDriveLetter = Read-Host "Enter ISO mount point drive letter (Ex: F)"

# Copy ISO files to USB drive
$source = "$($isoMountPointDriveLetter):\"
$destination = "$($usbDriveLetter):\"
robocopy $source $destination /COPYALL /Z /E /SEC /R:3 /W:3

# Make USB drive bootable
$usbDriveNumber = (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_DiskDrive | Where-Object {$_.InterfaceType -eq "USB" -and $_.DeviceID -like "*$usbDriveLetter"}).Index
bootsect /nt60 $usbDriveLetter | Out-Null

# Task completion notification
Write-Host "Copy operation complete"
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
```

# [Format as FAT32](#tab/format-fat32)

This script makes your USB drive bootable in FAT32 format. The FAT32 filesystem has a 4 GB limitation that requires the `install.wim` file to be split into multiple `SWM` files. This script accounts for this limitation and splits the `WIM` file accordingly.

```powershell
# Select USB drive letter
$usbDriveLetter = Read-Host "Enter USB drive letter (Ex: E)"

# Format USB drive
Format-Volume -DriveLetter $usbDriveLetter -FileSystem FAT32 -NewFileSystemLabel "ServerUSB" -Confirm:$false

# Select ISO file mount point
$isoMountPointDriveLetter = Read-Host "Enter ISO mount point drive letter (Ex: F)"

# Copy ISO files to USB drive
$source = "$($isoMountPointDriveLetter):\"
$destination = "$($usbDriveLetter):\"
robocopy $source $destination /COPYALL /Z /E /SEC /R:3 /W:3 /XF "$($isoMountPointDriveLetter):\sources\install.wim"

# Split install.wim file
Write-Host "[--- Splitting install.wim ---]"
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
Dism /Split-Image /ImageFile:"$($isoMountPointDriveLetter):\sources\install.wim" /SWMFile:"$($usbDriveLetter):\sources\install.swm" /FileSize:3800

# Copy split install.wim files to USB drive
$source = "$($isoMountPointDriveLetter):\sources\"
$destination = "$($usbDriveLetter):\sources\"
robocopy $source $destination /COPYALL /Z /E /SEC /R:3 /W:3 *.swm

# Make USB drive bootable
$usbDriveNumber = (Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_DiskDrive | Where-Object {$_.InterfaceType -eq "USB" -and $_.DeviceID -like "*$usbDriveLetter"}).Index
bootsect /nt60 $usbDriveLetter | Out-Null

# Task completion notification
Write-Host "Copy operation complete"
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
```

## Create a bootable DVD

1. Insert a dual-layer 8.5 GB DVD into your optical drive.
1. Locate your Windows Server installation ISO file.
1. Right-click on your ISO file and select **Burn disc image**.
1. The **Windows Disc Image Burner** wizard prompts you to select which **Disc burner** drive you'd like to use.
1. Select the appropriate drive and then select the **Burn** button.
1. This step is optional, but recommended to ensure that data integrity is verified against any errors or discrepancies between the burned disk and the original ISO image. Select the **Verify disc after burning** checkbox to detect any differences.

## Configure BIOS settings

Before you can install Windows Server via USB or DVD, the computer's boot order in the BIOS must be changed to ensure that the system boots from either the USB or DVD. Accessing the BIOS can vary depending on your hardware. In most cases, you can access the BIOS by pressing a specific key while your device boots. Typically, the key is either **F2**, **F10**, **F12**, or **Delete**. Refer to the user manual for your device. On certain hardware, once POST completes, there's a short window allowed for accessing the BIOS. You might need to repeatedly press one of the keys as soon as POST completes.

Once you're in the BIOS settings, navigate through the menus until you see the **Boot Order** or **Boot Sequence** option. Refer to the user manual for your device to locate this setting. Once you select the boot order setting, you can edit the boot order priority based in top-down order. Move booting from the USB or optical drive to the top of the list depending on which media installation method you're using. Once appropriate changes are made, save and exit from the BIOS. Your device reboots automatically in applying these changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If your system has two disks and you attempt to install Windows Server 2025 on the second disk, the installation might fail. This is because a Legacy BIOS system requires the OS to be installed on the primary disk enumerated by the BIOS, typically BIOS disk 0.
> If your BIOS allows explicit configuration of the primary BIOS enumerated disk, ensure you select the designated disk during installation. You can run `SELECT DISK=SYSTEM` in diskpart to identify the first BIOS enumerated disk.

## Install Windows Server

Once modifications are made to the boot order and you select to boot from either the USB or DVD drive, follow these steps to install Windows Server.
