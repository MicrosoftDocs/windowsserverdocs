Deploy Windows Server:

- **‚òÅÔ∏è In the cloud**

   Deploy Windows Server virtual machines in Azure for maximum scalability and global reach. Perfect for new applications, development environments, or when you need to scale quickly.

   **Best for**: New projects, variable workloads, global applications, and disaster recovery scenarios.

- **üè¢ In your datacenter**

   Upgrade your existing infrastructure to Windows Server for complete control over your environment. Ideal when you have specific compliance requirements, existing hardware investments, or need air-gapped environments.

   **Best for**: Regulated industries, existing infrastructure, specialized hardware requirements, and complete data control.

- **üåê Hybrid at the edge**

   Extend your datacenter to Azure with Azure Arc while keeping workloads running locally. Get the best of both worlds - local performance with cloud management and services.

   Keep sensitive workloads on-premises for compliance, performance, or cost reasons while gaining cloud management, monitoring, and services through Azure Arc. Perfect for organizations that need cloud benefits without full cloud commitment or data residency concerns.

   **Best for**: Gradual cloud adoption, distributed locations, edge computing scenarios, and using existing investments while gaining cloud capabilities.

## Editions

Windows Server offers two editions designed for different scales and virtualization needs:

| Edition | Standard | Datacenter |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Environments** | Physical servers or environments with limited virtualization needs | Highly virtualized environments and cloud scenarios |
| **Virtualization rights** | 2 virtual machines plus one Hyper-V host per license | Unlimited virtual machines plus one Hyper-V host per license |
| **Best for** | Small to medium deployments, specific workloads, cost-conscious environments | Large datacenters, cloud deployments, extensive virtualization |

Both editions include many of the same features and capabilites. For a detailed comparison, see:
