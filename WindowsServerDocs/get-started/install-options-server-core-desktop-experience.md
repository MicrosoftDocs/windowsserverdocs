# Server Core vs Server with Desktop Experience install options

When you install Windows Server using the setup wizard, you can choose between Server Core or Server with Desktop Experience install options. With Server Core, the standard graphical user interface (the Desktop Experience) is not installed; you manage the server from the command line using PowerShell, the [Server Configuration tool (SConfig)](../administration/server-core/server-core-sconfig.md), or by remote methods. Server with Desktop Experience installs the standard graphical user interface and all tools, including client experience features.

We recommend that you choose the Server Core install option unless you have a particular need for the extra user interface elements and graphical management tools that are included in the Server with Desktop Experience install option.

The setup wizard lists the install options below. In this list, editions without **Desktop Experience** are the Server Core install options:

- Windows Server Standard
- Windows Server Standard with Desktop Experience
- Windows Server Datacenter
- Windows Server Datacenter with Desktop Experience

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike some previous releases of Windows Server, you cannot convert between Server Core and Server with Desktop Experience after installation. You will need to do a [clean installation](install-upgrade-migrate.md) if you install later decide to use a different option.
