# Troubleshooting Windows volume activation

Product activation is the process of validating software after it's installed on a specific computer. Activation confirms that the product is genuine (not a fraudulent copy) and that the product key or serial number is valid and has not been compromised or revoked. Activation also establishes a link or relationship between the product key and the installation.

Volume activation is the process of activating volume-licensed products. To become a volume licensing customer, an organization must set up a volume licensing agreement with Microsoft. Microsoft offers customized volume licensing programs that accommodate the organization's size and purchasing preference. For more information, see the [Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).

The [Windows Server 2016 Activation Guide](server-2016-activation.md) focuses on the Key Management Service (KMS) activation technology. This section addresses common issues and provides troubleshooting guidelines for KMS and several other volume activation technologies.
