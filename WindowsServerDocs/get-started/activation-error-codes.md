# Troubleshooting Activation Error Codes

**Home users** This article is intended for use by support agents and IT professionals. If you're looking for more information about Windows activation error messages, go to the following Microsoft websites:

[Get help with Windows activation errors](https://support.microsoft.com/help/10738/windows-10-get-help-with-activation-errors) 

When you try to use a Multiple Activation Key (MAK) or the Key Management Service (KMS) to perform Volume Activation on one or more Windows-based computers, you receive error messages that contain specific error codes. This article discusses how to troubleshoot these errors.

**Error codes and descriptions**

|Error code |Error message |Activation type |Possible cause |Troubleshooting steps |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
|    0xC004C001    |    The activation server determined the specified   product key is invalid    |    MAK    |    An invalid MAK was entered.    |    Verify that the key is the MAK provided by   Microsoft. For   issues concerning your blocked activation please contact the [Microsoft Licensing Activation Centers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/existing-customer/activation-centers)     |
|    0xC004C003     |    The activation server determined the specified   product key is blocked    |    MAK    |    The MAK is blocked on the activation server.    |    Contact the : [Microsoft Licensing Activation Centers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/existing-customer/activation-centers) to obtain a new MAK and   install/activate the system.    |
|    0xC004C008     |    The activation server determined that the specified   product key could not be used.    |    KMS    |    The KMS key has exceeded the activation limit.    |    KMS host keys will activate up to 10 times on six   different computers. If more activations are necessary, contact the [Microsoft Licensing Activation Centers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/existing-customer/activation-centers).    |
|    0xC004B100    |    The activation server determined that the computer   could not be activated.    |    MAK    |    This issue may occur if the MAK is unsupported.    |    To troubleshoot this issue, verify that the MAK that   is used is the MAK that was provided by Microsoft. To verify that the MAK is   valid, contact the : [Microsoft Licensing Activation Centers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/existing-customer/activation-centers).    |
|    0xC004C020     |    The activation server reported that the Multiple   Activation Key has exceeded its limit.    |    MAK    |    The MAK has exceeded the activation limit.    |    MAKs by design have a limited number of activations.   Contact the [Microsoft Licensing Activation Centers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/existing-customer/activation-centers).    |
|    0xC004C021     |    The activation server reported that the Multiple   Activation Key extension limit has been exceeded.    |    MAK    |    The MAK has exceeded the activation limit.    |    MAKs by design have a limited number of activations.   Contact the [Microsoft Licensing Activation Centers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/existing-customer/activation-centers)    |
|    0xC004F009     |    The Software Protection Service reported that the   grace period expired.    |    MAK    |    The grace period expired before the system was   activated. Now, the system is in the Notifications state.    |    See the section “User Experience.”    |
|    0xC004F00F     |    The Software Licensing Server reported that the   hardware ID binding is beyond level of tolerance.    |    MAK/KMS client/KMS host    |    The hardware has changed or the drivers were updated   on the system.    |    MAK: Reactivate the system during the OOT grace period using either   online or phone activation.      KMS: Restart, or run slmgr.vbs   /ato.    |
|    0xC004F014     |    The Software Protection Service reported that the   product key is not available    |    MAK/KMS client    |    No product keys are installed on the system.    |    Install a MAK product key, or install a KMS Setup   key found in \sources\pid.txt on the installation media.    |
|    0xC004F02C     |    The Software Protection Service reported that the   format for the offline activation data is incorrect.    |    MAK/KMS client    |    The system has detected that the data entered during   phone activation is not valid.    |    Verify that the CID is correctly entered.    |
|    0xC004F035     |    This error code equates to “The Software Protection   Service reported that the computer could not be activated with a Volume   license product key...” The error text is correct, but is ambiguous. This   error indicates that the computer is missing a Windows marker in the BIOS –   provided on OEM systems to indicate computers shipping with qualifying   editions of Windows, which is a requirement for KMS client activation. Error:   Invalid Volume License Key In order to activate, you need to change your   product key to a valid Multiple Activation Key (MAK) or Retail key. You must   have a qualifying operating system license AND a Volume license Windows 7   upgrade license, or a full license for Windows 7 from a retail source. ANY   OTHER INSTALLATION OF THIS SOFTWARE IS IN VIOLATION OF YOUR AGREEMENT AND   APPLICABLE COPYRIGHT LAW.    |    KMS client/KMS host    |    Windows 7 Volume editions are licensed for upgrade   only. Installing a Volume operating system on a computer that does not have a   qualifying operating system installed is not supported.    |    Install a qualifying version of a Microsoft   operating system, and then activate by using a MAK.    |
|    0xC004F038     |    The Software Protection Service reported that the   computer could not be activated. The count reported by your Key Management   Service (KMS) is insufficient. Please contact your system administrator.    |    KMS client    |    The count on the KMS host is not high enough. The KMS   count must be ≥5 for Windows Server or ≥25 for Windows client.    |    More computers are needed in the KMS pool for KMS   clients to activate. Run Slmgr.vbs /dli to get   the current count on the KMS host.    |
|    0xC004F039     |    The Software Protection Service reported that the   computer could not be activated. The Key Management Service (KMS) is not   enabled.    |    KMS client    |    This error occurs when a KMS request is not   answered.    |    Troubleshoot the network connection between the KMS   host and the client. Make sure that TCP port 1688 (default) is not blocked by   a firewall or otherwise filtered.    |
|    0xC004F041     |    The Software Protection Service determined that the   Key Management Server (KMS) is not activated. KMS needs to be activated.    |    KMS client    |    The KMS host is not activated.    |    Activate the KMS host with either online or phone   activation.    |
|    0xC004F042     |    The Software Protection Service determined that the   specified Key Management Service (KMS) cannot be used.    |    KMS client    |    Mismatch between the KMS client and the KMS host.    |    This error occurs when a KMS client contacts a KMS   host that cannot activate the client software. This can be common in mixed   environments that contain application and operating system-specific KMS   hosts, for example.    |
|    0xC004F050     |    The Software Protection Service reported that the   product key is invalid.    |    KMS, KMS client, MAK    |    This can be caused by a typo in the KMS key or by   typing in a Beta key on a Released version of the operating system.    |    Install the appropriate KMS key on the corresponding   version of Windows. Check the spelling. If the key is being copied and   pasted, make sure that em-dashes have not been substituted for the dashes in   the key.    |
|    0xC004F051     |    The Software Protection Service reported that the   product key is blocked.    |    MAK/KMS    |    The product key on the activation server is blocked   by Microsoft.    |    Obtain a new MAK/KMS key, install it on the system,   and activate.    |
|    0xC004F064     |    The Software Protection Service reported that the   non-genuine grace period expired.    |    MAK    |    Windows Activation Tools (WAT) has determined the   system is not genuine.    |    See the Volume Activation Operations Guide.    |
|    0xC004F065     |    The Software Protection Service reported that the   application is running within the valid non-genuine period.    |    MAK/KMS client    |    Windows Activation Tools has determined that the   system is not genuine. The system will continue to run during the Non-Genuine   grace period.    |    Obtain and install a genuine product key, and   activate the system during the grace period. Otherwise, the system will go   into the Notifications state at the end of the grace period.    |
|    0xC004F06C     |    The Software Protection Service reported that the computer   could not be activated. The Key Management Service (KMS) determined that the   request timestamp is invalid.    |    KMS client    |    The system time on the client computer is too   different from the time on the KMS host.    |    Time sync is important to system and network   security for a variety of reasons. Fix this issue by changing the system time   on the client to sync with the KMS. Use of a Network Time Protocol (NTP) time   source or Active Directory Domain Services for time synchronization is   recommended. This issue uses UTP time and is independent of Time Zone   selection.    |
|    0x80070005     |    Access denied. The requested action requires   elevated privileges.    |    KMS client/MAK/KMS host    |    User Account Control (UAC) prohibits activation   processes from running in a non-elevated command prompt.    |    Run slmgr.vbs from an elevated command prompt.   Right-click cmd.exe, and then click Run as Administrator.    |
|    0x8007232A     |    DNS server failure.    |    KMS host    |    The system has network or DNS issues.    |    Troubleshoot network and DNS.    |
|    0x8007232B     |    DNS name does not exist.    |    KMS client    |    The KMS client cannot find KMS SRV RRs in DNS. If a   KMS host does not exist on the network, a MAK should be installed.    |    Confirm that a KMS host has been installed and DNS   publishing is enabled (default). If DNS is unavailable, point the KMS client   to the KMS host by using slmgr.vbs /skms   <kms_host_name>.Optionally, obtain and install a MAK; then,   activate the system. Finally, troubleshoot DNS.    |
|    0x800706BA     |    The RPC server is unavailable.    |    KMS client    |    Firewall settings are not configured on the KMS   host, or DNS SRV records are stale.    |    Ensure the Key Management Service firewall exception   is enabled on the KMS host machine. Ensure that SRV records point to a valid   KMS host. Troubleshoot network connections.    |
|    0x8007251D     |    No records found for DNS query.    |    KMS client    |    The KMS client cannot find KMS SRV RRs in DNS.    |    Troubleshoot network connections and DNS.    |
|    0xC004F074     |    The Software Protection Service reported that the   computer could not be activated. No Key Management Service (KMS) could be   contacted. Please see the Application Event Log for additional information.    |    KMS Client    |    All KMS host systems returned an error.    |    Troubleshoot errors from each event ID 12288   associated with the activation attempt.    |
|    0x8004FE21     |    This computer is not running genuine Windows.    |    MAK/KMS client    |    This issue may occur for several reasons. The most   likely reason is that language packs (MUI) have been installed on computers   that are running Windows editions that are not licensed for additional   language packs. (Note This is not necessarily an indication of tampering.   Some applications can install multi-lingual support even when that edition of   Windows is not licensed for those language packs.) This issue may also occur   if Windows has been modified by malware to allow additional features to be   installed. This issue may also occur if certain system files are corrupted.    |    To resolve this issue, you must reinstall the   operating system.    |
|    0x80092328     |    0x80092328 DNS name does not exist.    |    KMS Client    |    This issue may occur if the KMS client cannot find   the KMS SRV resource records in DNS.    |    To work around this issue, follow the steps in the   following Microsoft Knowledge Base article: 929826 Error message when you try   to activate Windows Vista Enterprise, Windows Vista Business, Windows 7, or   Windows Server 2008: "Code 0x8007232b"    |
|    0x8007007b    |    0x8007007b DNS name does not exist.    |    KMS Client    |    This issue may occur if the KMS client cannot find   the KMS SRV resource records in DNS.    |    To work around this issue, follow the steps in the   following Microsoft Knowledge Base article: 929826 Error message when you try   to activate Windows Vista Enterprise, Windows Vista Business, Windows 7, or   Windows Server 2008: "Code 0x8007232b"    |
|    0x80070490    |The product key you entered didn't work.  Check the product key and try again, or enter a different one. |MAK |This issue occurs because an invalid MAK was entered, or because of a known issue in Windows Server 2019. |To work around this issue, activate the computer by using the command line **slmgr -ipk \<5x5 key\>**|
