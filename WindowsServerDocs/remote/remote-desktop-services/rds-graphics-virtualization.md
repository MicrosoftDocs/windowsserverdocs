# Remote Desktop Services - GPU acceleration

Remote Desktop Services (RDS) works with native graphics acceleration and the graphics virtualization technologies supported by Windows Server. For information on those technologies, their differences, and how to deploy them, see [Plan for GPU acceleration in Windows Server](../../virtualization/hyper-v/plan/plan-for-gpu-acceleration-in-windows-server.md).

When you plan for graphics acceleration in your RDS environment, your choice of user scale and user workloads drives which graphics rendering technology you use:
