# Remote Desktop Services - GPU acceleration

Remote Desktop Services works with native graphics acceleration as well as the graphics virtualization technologies supported by Windows Server. For information on those technologies, their differences, and how to deploy them, see [Plan for GPU acceleration in Windows Server](../../virtualization/hyper-v/plan/plan-for-gpu-acceleration-in-windows-server.md).

When planning for graphics acceleration in your RDS environment, your choice of user scale and user workloads will drive your choice of graphics rendering technology:
