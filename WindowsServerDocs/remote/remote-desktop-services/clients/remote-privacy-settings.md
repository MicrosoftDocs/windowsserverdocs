# Privacy settings for managed apps and desktops

>Applies to: Windows 10, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019

When accessing managed resources (apps or desktops) provided by your IT administrator, the privacy settings for the remote system have been preconfigured by your IT administrator. These settings may be different than the privacy settings on your local system. If you have questions, contact your IT administrator.

>[!NOTE]
>Using managed resources in regions other than the United States may result in data transfer to the United States.

These are some of the Windows 10 privacy settings you can configure in your managed desktop:
