## Get the Remote Desktop client and start using it

This section will tell you how to download and set up the Remote Desktop client for iOS.

### Download the Remote Desktop client from the iOS store

First you'll need to download the client and configure your PC to connect to remote resources.

To download the client:

1. Download the Microsoft Remote Desktop client from the [iOS App Store](https://aka.ms/rdios) or [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id714464092?mt=8).
2. [Set up your PC to accept remote connections](remote-desktop-client-faq.md#how-do-i-set-up-a-pc-for-remote-desktop).

### Add a PC

After you've downloaded the client and configured your PC to accept remote connections, it's time to actually add a PC.

To add a PC:

1. In the Connection Center, tap **+**, then tap **Add PC**.
2. Enter the following information:
   - **PC name** – the name of the computer. The PC name can be a Windows computer name, an Internet domain name, or an IP address. You can also append port information to the PC name (for example, **MyDesktop:3389** or **10.0.0.1:3389**).
   - **User name** – The user name you'll use to access the remote PC. You can use the following formats: *user_name*, *domain\user_name*, or `user_name@domain.com`. You can also select **Ask when required** to be prompted for a user name and password when necessary.
3. You can also set the following additional options:
   - **Friendly name (optional)** – An easy-to-remember name for the PC you're connecting to. You can use any string, but if you don't specify a friendly name, the PC name is displayed instead.
   - **Gateway (optional)** – The Remote Desktop gateway that you want to use to connect to virtual desktops, RemoteApp programs, and session-based desktops on an internal corporate network. Get the information about the gateway from your system administrator.
   - **Sound** – Select the device to use for audio during your remote session. You can choose to play sound on the local devices, the remote device, or not at all.
   - **Swap mouse buttons** – Whenever a mouse gesture would send a command with the left mouse button, it sends the same command with the right mouse button instead. Swapping mouse buttons is necessary if the remote PC is configured for left-handed mouse mode.
   - **Admin Mode** - Connect to an administration session on a server running Windows Server 2003 or later.
   - **Clipboard** - Choose whether to redirect text and images in your clipboard to your PC.
   - **Storage** - Choose whether to redirect storage to your PC.
4. Tap **Save**.

Need to edit these settings? Press and hold the desktop you want to edit, then tap the settings icon.

### Add a workspace

To get a list of managed resources you can access on your iOS, add a workspace by subscribing to the feed provided by your admin.

To add a workspace:

1. On the Connection Center screen, tap **+**, and then tap **Add workspace**.
2. In the Feed URL field, enter the URL for the feed you want to add. This URL can be either a URL or an email address.
   - If you use a URL, use the one your admin gave you.
      - This URL is usually a Windows Virtual Desktop URL. Which one you use depends on which version of Windows Virtual Desktop you're using.
        - For Windows Virtual Desktop (classic), use `https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/api/feeddiscovery/webfeeddiscovery.aspx`.
        - For Windows Virtual Desktop, use `https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/api/arm/feeddiscovery`.
   - If you use an email address, enter your email address. Entering your email address tells the client ot search for a URL associated with your email address if your admin configured the server that way.
3. Tap **Next**.
4. Provide your credentials when prompted.
   - For **User name**, give the user name of an account with permission to access resources.
   - For **Password**, give the password for the account.
   - You may also be prompted to give additional information depending on the settings your admin configured authentication with.
5. Tap **Save**.

After you've finished, the Connection Center should display the remote resources.

Once subscribed to a feed, the feed's content will update automatically on a regular basis. Resources may be added, changed, or removed based on changes made by your administrator.

## Manage your user accounts

When you connect to a PC or workspace, you can save the user accounts to select from again.

To create a new user account:

1. In the Connection Center, tap **Settings**, and then tap **User Accounts**.
2. Tap **Add User Account**.
3. Enter the following information:
   - **User Name** - The name of the user to save for use with a remote connection. You can enter the user name in any of the following formats: `user_name`, `domain\user_name`, or `user_name@domain.com`.
   - **Password** - The password for the user you specified.
4. Tap **Save**.

To delete a user account:

1. In the Connection Center, tap **Settings**, and then tap **User Accounts**.
2. Select the account you would like to delete.
3. Tap **Delete**.

## Connect to an RD Gateway to access internal assets

A Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) lets you connect to a remote computer on a corporate network from anywhere on the Internet. You can create and manage your gateways using the Remote Desktop client.

To set up a new gateway:

1. In the Connection Center, tap **Settings** > **Gateways**.
2. Tap **Add gateway**.
3. Enter the following information:
   - **Gateway name** – The name of the computer you want to use as a gateway. The gateway name can be a Windows computer name, an Internet domain name, or an IP address. You can also add port information to the server name (for example, **RDGateway:443** or **10.0.0.1:443**).
   - **User name** - The user name and password to be used for the Remote Desktop gateway you're connecting to. You can also select **Use connection credentials** to use the same user name and password that you used for the remote desktop connection.

## Supported input devices

The client has [Bluetooth mouse support](https://support.apple.com/HT210546) for iOS 13 and iPadOS as an accessibility feature. You can use Swiftpoint GT or ProPoint mice for deeper mouse integration. The client also supports external keyboards that are compatible with iOS and iPadOS.

For more information about device support, see [What's new in the iOS client](ios-whatsnew.md) and the [iOS App Store](https://aka.ms/rdios).

> [!TIP]
> Swiftpoint is offering an [exclusive discount on the ProPoint mouse](https://www.swiftpoint.com/microsoft) for iOS client users.

## Use a keyboard in a remote session

You can use either an on-screen keyboard or physical keyboard in your remote session.

For on-screen keyboards, use the button on the right edge of the bar above the keyboard to switch between the standard and additional keyboard.

If Bluetooth is enabled for your iOS device, the client automatically detects the Bluetooth keyboard.

While certain key combinations might not work as expected in a remote session, many of the common Windows key combinations, such as CTRL+C, CTRL+V, and ALT+TAB will work.
