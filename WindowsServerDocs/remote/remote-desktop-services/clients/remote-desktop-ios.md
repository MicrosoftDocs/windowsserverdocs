## Get the Remote Desktop Beta client and start using it
The iOS Beta client available today through Apple TestFlight supports connections to Windows Virtual Desktop resources.

### Download the Remote Desktop iOS Beta client from Apple TestFlight
Here's how to set up the Remote Desktop Beta client on your iOS device:

1. Install the [Apple TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) app on your iOS device.
2. On your iOS device, open a browser and navigate to [aka.ms/rdiosbeta](https://aka.ms/rdiosbeta).
3. Under the label **Step 2 Join the Beta** select **Start Testing**.
4. When you are redirected to the TestFlight app, select **Accept** and then **Install** the client.

### Add a connection to a PC
To create a remote connection to a PC:

1. In the Connection Center, tap **+**, and then tap **Add PC**.
2. Enter the name of the remote PC into **PC Name**. This can be a Windows computer name, an Internet domain name, or an IP address. You can also append port information to the PC name (for example, **MyDesktop:3389** or **10.0.0.1:3389**).
3. Select the **User Account** you'll use to access the remote PC.
   - Select **Ask Every Time** for the client to ask for your credentials every time you connect to the remote PC.
   - Select **Add User Account** to save an account that you use frequently so you don't have to enter credentials every time you sign in. Follow [these instructions](#manage-your-user-accounts) to manage your user accounts.
4. You can also set the following optional parameters:
   - In **Friendly Name**, you can enter an easier-to-remember name for the PC you're connecting to.
   - **Admin Mode** lets you connect to an admin session on the remote PC.
   - **Swap Mouse Buttons** switches the commands sent by right and left mouse gestures. Ideal for left-handed users.
   - The **Gateway** is the Remote Desktop gateway you'll use to connect to a computer from an external network. Contact your system administrator for more information.
   - **Sound** selects the device your remote session uses for audio. You can choose to play sound on your local device, the remote device, or not at all.
   - **Microphone** enables microphone redirection. This setting is disabled by default.
   - **Camera** enables camera redirection. This setting is disabled by default.
   - **Clipboard** enables clipboard redirection. This setting is enabled by default.
   - **Storage** enables local storage redirection. This setting is disabled by default.
5. Select **Save** to add the remote PC connection.

### Add remote resources
Remote resources are RemoteApp programs, session-based desktops, and virtual desktops published by your admin. The iOS client supports resources published from **Remote Desktop Services** and **Windows Virtual Desktop** deployments. To add remote resources:

1. In the Connection Center tap **+**, and then tap **Add Workspace**.
2. Enter the **Feed URL**. This can be a URL or email address:
   - The **URL** is the RD Web Access server's URL, provided to you by your admin. If accessing resources from Windows Virtual Desktop, you can use `https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com`.
   - If you plan to use **Email**, enter your email address in this field. This tells the client to search for an RD Web Access server associated with your email address if it was configured by your admin.
3. Tap **Next**.
4. Provide your sign in information when prompted. This can vary based on the deployment and can include:
   - **User name**, the user name that has permission to access the resources.
   - **Password**, the password associated with the user name.
   - **Additional factor**, which you may be prompted for if authentication was configured that way by your admin.
5. Tap **Save**.

The remote resources will be displayed in the Connection Center.

## Get the Remote Desktop client and start using it

### Download the Remote Desktop client from the iOS store

Follow these steps to get started with Remote Desktop on your iOS device:

3. Add a [Remote Desktop connection](#add-a-remote-desktop-connection) or a [remote resource](#add-a-remote-resource). You use a connection to connect to a directly to a Windows PC and a remote resource to use a RemoteApp program, session-based desktop, or a virtual desktop published on-premises using RemoteApp and Desktop Connections. This feature is typically available in corporate environments.

### Add a Remote Desktop connection

To create a remote desktop connection:

1. In the Connection Center tap **+**, and then tap **Add PC or Server**.
2. Enter the following information for the remote desktop connection:
   - **PC name** – the name of the computer. This can be a Windows computer name, an Internet domain name, or an IP address. You can also append port information to the PC name (for example, **MyDesktop:3389** or **10.0.0.1:3389**).
   - **User name** – The user name to use to access the remote PC. You can use the following formats: *user_name*, *domain\user_name*, or `user_name@domain.com`. You can also specify whether to prompt for a user name and password.
3. You can also set the following additional options:
   - **Friendly name (optional)** – An easy-to-remember name for the PC you are connecting to. You can use any string, but if you do not specify a friendly name, the PC name is displayed.
   - **Gateway (optional)** – The Remote Desktop gateway that you want to use to connect to virtual desktops, RemoteApp programs, and session-based desktops on an internal corporate network. Get the information about the gateway from your system administrator.
   - **Sound** – Select the device to use for audio during your remote session. You can choose to play sound on the local devices, the remote device, or not at all.
   - **Swap mouse buttons** – Whenever a mouse gesture would send a command with the left mouse button, it sends the same command with the right mouse button instead. This is necessary if the remote PC is configured for left-handed mouse mode.

## Use touch gestures and mouse modes in a remote session

The client uses standard touch gestures. You can also use touch gestures to replicate mouse actions on the remote desktop. The mouse modes available are defined in the table below.

> [!NOTE]
> Interacting with Windows 8 or newer the native touch gestures are supported in Direct Touch mode. For more information on Windows 8 gestures see [Touch: Swipe, tap, and beyond](https://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/touch-swipe-tap-beyond).

| Mouse mode    | Mouse operation      | Gesture                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Direct touch  | Left click           | 1 finger tap                                               |
| Direct touch  | Right click          | 1 finger tap and hold                                      |

## Supported input devices

The [Remote Desktop iOS beta client](https://aka.ms/rdiosbeta) supports the Swiftpoint GT and ProPoint physical mice. Swiftpoint is offering an [exclusive discount](https://www.swiftpoint.com/microsoft/) on the GT for iOS beta client users.

The iOS client currently only supports Swiftpoint mice. Refer to the [What's new in the iOS client](ios-whatsnew.md) page and the [iOS App Store](https://aka.ms/rdios) for news about support for other devices in the future.

## Use a keyboard in a remote session

You can use either an on-screen keyboard or physical keyboard in your remote session.

For on-screen keyboards, use the button on the right edge of the bar above the keyboard to switch between the standard and additional keyboard.

If Bluetooth is enabled for your iOS device, the client automatically detects the Bluetooth keyboard.

Be aware that, due to limitations on the OS, special keys such as Ctrl, Option, and Function will not work as expected with a Bluetooth keyboard. The following keys work:

- Alphanumeric keys
- Cursor keys
- Tab: Tab works, but Shift+Tab does not work
- Home / Pos1: Alt+Left = Home
- End: Alt+Right = End
- Page Up: Alt+Up = Page Up
- Page Down: Alt+Down = Page Down
- Select All: Command+A = Ctrl+A (Select all in most programs)
- Cut: Command+X = Ctrl+X (Cut in most programs)
- Copy: Command+C = Ctrl+C (Copy in most programs)
- Paste: Command+V = Ctrl+V (Paste in most programs)
- Symbols: Alt+Alphanumeric keys will produce different symbols depending on the language configured
