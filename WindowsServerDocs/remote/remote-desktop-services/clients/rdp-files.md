# Supported RDP properties with Remote Desktop Services

Organizations can configure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) properties centrally in Remote Desktop
Services (RDS) to determine how a connection should behave. There are a wide range of RDP properties
that can be set, such as for device redirection, display settings, session behavior, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> Supported RDP properties differ when using Remote Desktop
> Services compared to Azure Virtual Desktop. Use the following tables to understand each setting and whether it applies when
> connecting to Remote Desktop Services, Azure Virtual Desktop, or both.
