# Supported Remote Desktop RDP file settings

The following table includes the list of supported RDP file settings that you can use with the Remote Desktop clients. When configuring settings, check [Client comparisons](./remote-desktop-app-compare.md) to see which redirections each client supports.

The table also highlights which settings are supported as custom properties with Windows Virtual Desktop. You can refer to [this documentation](/azure/virtual-desktop/customize-rdp-properties/) detailing how to use PowerShell to customize RDP properties for Windows Virtual Desktop host pools.
