Use the following information to get started. Be sure to check out the [FAQ](remote-desktop-client-faq.yml) if you have any questions.

> [!NOTE]
> - Curious about the new releases for the Microsoft Store Client? Check out [What's new in the Microsoft Store Client](windows-whatsnew.md)
> - You can run the client on any supported version of Windows 10.

## Get the RD client and start using it

Follow these steps to get started with Remote Desktop on your Windows 10 device:

1. Download the Remote Desktop client from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/microsoft-remote-desktop/9wzdncrfj3ps).
2. [Set up your PC to accept remote connections](remote-desktop-allow-access.md).
3. Add a Remote PC connection or a workspace. You use a connection to connect directly to a Windows PC and a workspace to use a RemoteApp program, session-based desktop, or virtual desktop published by your admin.
4. Pin items so you can get to Remote Desktop quickly.

### Add a Remote PC connection

To create a Remote PC connection:

1. In the Connection Center, tap **+ Add**, and then tap **PCs**.
2. Enter the following information for the computer you want to connect to:
   - **PC name** – the name of the computer. The PC name can be a Windows computer name, an Internet domain name, or an IP address. You can also append port information to the PC name (for example, **MyDesktop:3389** or **10.0.0.1:3389**).
   - **User account** – The user account to use to access the remote PC. Tap **+** to add a new account or select an existing account. You can use the following formats for the username: *user_name*, *domain\user_name*, or <em>user_name@domain.com</em>. You can also specify whether to prompt for credentials during the connection by selecting **Ask me every time**.
3. You can also set additional options by tapping on **Show more**:
   - **Display name** – An easy-to-remember name for the PC you're connecting to. You can use any string, but if you don't specify a friendly name, the PC name is displayed.
   - **Group** – Specify a group to make it easier to find your connections later. You can add a new group by tapping **+** or select one from the list.
   - **Gateway** – The Remote PC gateway that you want to use to connect to virtual PCs, RemoteApp programs, and session-based PCs on an internal corporate network. Get the information about the gateway from your system administrator.
   - **Connect to admin session** - Use this option to connect to a console session to administrate a Windows server.
   - **Swap mouse buttons** – Use this option to swap the left mouse button functions for the right mouse button. Swapping mouse buttons is necessary when you use a PC configured for a left-handed user but you only have a right-handed mouse.
   - **Set my remote session resolution to:** – Select the resolution you want to use in the session. **Choose for me** will set the resolution based on the size of the client.
   - **Change the size of the display:** – When selecting a high static resolution for the session, you can use this setting to make items on the screen appear larger to improve readability. This setting only applies when connecting to Windows 8.1 or later.
   - **Update the remote session resolution on resize** – When enabled, the client will dynamically update the session resolution based on the size of the client. This setting only applies when connecting to Windows 8.1 or later.
   - **Clipboard** – When enabled, allows you to copy text and images to/from the remote PC.
   - **Audio Playback** – Select the device to use for audio during your remote session. You can choose to play sound on the local devices, the remote PC, or not at all.
   - **Audio Recording** – When enabled, allows you to use a local microphone with applications on the remote PC.
4. Tap **Save**.

Need to edit these settings? Tap the overflow menu (**...**) next to the name of the PC, and then tap **Edit**.

Want to delete the connection? Again, tap the overflow menu (**...**), and then tap **Remove**.

### Add a workspace

Workspaces are RemoteApp programs, session-based desktops, and virtual desktops published by your admin using Remote Desktop Services.

To add a workspace:

1. On the Connection Center screen, tap **+ Add**, and then tap **Workspaces**.
2. Enter the **Feed URL** provided by your admin and tap **Find feeds**.
3. When prompted, provide the credentials to subscribe to the feed.

The workspaces will be displayed in the Connection Center.

To delete workspaces:

1. In the Connection Center, tap the overflow menu (**...**) next to the workspace.
2. Tap **Remove**.

### Pin a saved PC to your Start menu

To pin a connection to your Start menu, tap the overflow menu (**...**) next to the name of the PC, and then tap **Pin to Start**.

Now you can start the PC connection directly from your Start menu by tapping it.

## Connect to an RD Gateway to access internal assets

A Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) lets you connect to a remote computer on a corporate network from anywhere on the Internet. You can create and manage your gateways using the Remote Desktop client.

To set up a new gateway:

1. In the Connection Center, tap **Settings**.
2. Next to Gateway, tap **+** to add a new gateway.

      >[!NOTE]
      >You can also add a gateway when you add a new connection.

3. Enter the following information:
   - **Server name** – The name of the computer you want to use as a gateway. The server name can be a Windows computer name, an Internet domain name, or an IP address. You can also add port information to the server name (for example: **RDGateway:443** or **10.0.0.1:443**).
   - **User account** - Select or add a user account to use with the Remote PC Gateway you're connecting to. You can also select **Use desktop user account** to use the same credentials that you used for the remote PC connection.
4. Tap **Save**.

## Global app settings

You can set the following global settings in your client by tapping **Settings**:

### Managed items

- **User account** - Allows you to add, edit, and delete user accounts saved in the client. You can also update the password for an account after it's changed.
- **Gateway** - Allows you to add, edit, and delete gateway servers saved in the client.
- **Group** - Allows you to add, edit, and delete groups saved in the client. You can also group connections here.

### Session settings

- **Start connections in full screen** - When enabled, anytime a connection is launched, the client will use the entire screen of the current monitor.
- **Start each connection in a new window** - When enabled, each connection is launched in a separate window, allowing you to place them on different monitors and switch between them using the taskbar.
- **When resizing the app:** - Allows you control over what happens when the client window is resized. Defaults to **Stretch the content, preserving aspect ratio**.
- **Use keyboard commands with:** - Lets you specify where keyboard commands like *WIN* or *ALT+TAB* are used. The default is to only send them to the session when the connection is in full screen.
- **Prevent the screen from timing out** - Allows you to keep the screen from timing out when a session is active. Preventing timeout is helpful when the connection doesn't need interaction for long periods of time.

### App settings

- **Show PC Previews** - Lets you see a preview of a PC in the Connection Center before you connect to it. This setting is on by default.
- **Help improve Remote Desktop** - Sends anonymous data to Microsoft. We use this data to improve the client. To learn more about how we treat this anonymous and private data, see the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement). This setting is on by default.

### Manage your user accounts

When you connect to a PC or workspace, you can save the account's information to connect to it later. You can also define user accounts within the client instead of saving the user data when you connect to a PC.

To create a new user account:

1. In the Connection Center, tap **Settings**.
2. Next to User account, tap **+** to add a new user account.
3. Enter the following information:
   - **Username** - The name of the user to save for use with a remote connection. You can enter the user name in any of the following formats: user_name, domain\user_name, or user_name@domain.com.
   - **Password** - The password for the user you specified. This field can be left blank to be prompted for a password during the connection.
4. Tap **Save**.

To delete a user account:

1. In the Connection Center, tap **Settings**.
2. Select the account to delete from the list under User account.
3. Next to User account, tap the edit icon.
4. Tap **Remove this account** at the bottom to delete the user account.
5. You can also edit the user account and tap **Save**.
