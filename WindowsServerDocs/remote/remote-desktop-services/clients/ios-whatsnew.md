# What's new in the iOS client

We regularly update the [Remote Desktop client for iOS](remote-desktop-ios.md), adding new features and fixing issues. You'll find the latest updates on this page.

## How to report issues

We're committed to making the Remote Desktop client for iOS the best it can be, so we value your feedback. You can report any issues at **Help** > **Report an Issue**.

## Updates for version 10.2.5

*Date published: 03/29/2021*

It's time for a small update to address some reported bugs. In this version, we made the following updates:

- Fixed NETBIOS name resolution on iOS 14.
- Updated the app to proactively request local network access to enable connections to PCs around you.
- Fixed an issue where an RD Gateway connection would fail with a 0x3000064 error code.
- Fixed a bug where workspace discovery and download would fail if the port number was included in HTTP GET requests.
- Added examples of PC host names to the PC Name page in the Add/Edit PC UX.

## Updates for version 10.2.4

*Date published: 02/01/2021*

- Addressed an issue where the UI would stop resolving a workspace name during subscription.

## Updates for version 10.2.3

In this release, we've fixed issues that caused crashes and interfered with the "Display Zoom View" setting. We've also tweaked the "Use Full Display" setting to only appear on applicable iPads and adjusted the available resolutions for iPhones and iPads.

## Updates for version 10.2.2

*Date published: 11/23/2020*

In this release, we've addressed some bugs affecting users running iOS 14 and iPadOS 14.

## Updates for version 10.2.0

## Updates for version 10.1.3

*Date published: 11/06/2020*
