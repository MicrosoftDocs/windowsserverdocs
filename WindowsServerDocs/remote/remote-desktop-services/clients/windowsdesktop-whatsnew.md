- Added a new **Subscribe with URL** option that allows you to specify the URL of the Workspace you are subscribing to or leverage [email discovery](../rds-email-discovery.md) when available in cases where we can't automatically find your resources. This is similar to the subscription process in the other Remote Desktop clients. This can be used to subscribe directly to Windows Virtual Desktop workspaces.

## Updates for version 1.2.945

*Date published: 04/28/2020*

- Added new display settings options for desktop connections available when right-clicking a desktop icon on the Connection Center.
  - There are now three display configuration options: **All displays**, **Single display** and **Select displays**.
  - We now only show available settings when a display configuration is selected.

  - We've added a new **Single display when windowed** option for all displays and select displays modes. This option switches your session automatically to a single display when you exit full screen mode, and automatically returns to multiple displays when you maximize the window.
- We've added a new **Display settings** group to the system menu that appears when you right-click the title bar of a windowed desktop session. This will let you change some settings dynamically during a session. For example, you can change the new **Single display mode when windowed** and **Maximize to current displays** settings.
- When you exit full screen, the session window will return to its original location when you first entered full screen.
- The background refresh for Workspaces has been changed to every four hours instead of every hour. A refresh now happens automatically when launching the client.
