- Client version must be at or above the minimum supported version. For more information, see [What's new in the Windows Desktop client](windowsdesktop-whatsnew.md).

- Client devices must have .NET Framework 4.6.1 or above. For more information, [Lifecycle FAQ - .NET Framework](/lifecycle/faq/dotnet-framework).
