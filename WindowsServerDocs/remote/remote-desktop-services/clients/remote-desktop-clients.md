# Remote Desktop clients

>Applies to: Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2

You can use a Microsoft Remote Desktop client to connect to a remote PC and your work resources from almost anywhere using just about any device. You can connect to your work PC and have access to all of your apps, files, and network resources as if you were sitting at your desk. You can leave apps open at work and then see those same apps at home - all by using the RD client.

Before you start, make sure you check out the [supported configuration](remote-desktop-supported-config.md) article, which discusses the PCs that you can connect to using the Remote Desktop clients. Also check out the [client FAQ](remote-desktop-client-faq.md).

The following client apps are available:

| Device          | Get the app                                                                                                  | Set up instructions                                                                |

## Remote Desktop client URI scheme

You can integrate features of Remote Desktop clients across platforms by enabling a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme. Check out the [supported URI attributes](remote-desktop-uri.md) that you can use with the iOS, Mac, and Android clients.
