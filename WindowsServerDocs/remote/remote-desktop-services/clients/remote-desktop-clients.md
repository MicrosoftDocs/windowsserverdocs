# Remote Desktop clients

>Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2

Microsoft Remote Desktop clients let you use and control a remote PC. With a Remote Desktop client, you can do all the things with a remote PC that you can do with a physical PC, such as:

- Use apps installed on the remote PC.
- Access files and network resources on the remote PC.
- Leave the apps open when you turn off the client.

You can also use a Remote Desktop client to access your remote PC from almost any device. There are even clients for mobile smartphones! Here's a list of the latest versions of the client apps and where you can download them:

| Client | Get the app | Documentation | Latest version |
|-----------------|-------------|------|---|
| Windows Desktop | [Windows Desktop client](windowsdesktop.md#install-the-client) | [Get started](windowsdesktop.md), [What's new](windowsdesktop-whatsnew.md) | 1.2.2691  |
| Microsoft Store   | [Windows 10 client in the Microsoft Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616709) | [Get started](windows.md), [What's new](windows-whatsnew.md)  | 1.2.1810  |
| Android         | [Android client in Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.rdc.androidx)     | [Get started](remote-desktop-android.md), [What's new](android-whatsnew.md) | 10.0.12.1148 |
| iOS             | [iOS client in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id714464092)     | [Get started](remote-desktop-ios.md), [What's new](ios-whatsnew.md)         | 10.3.6 |
| macOS | [macOS client in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12) | [Get started](remote-desktop-mac.md), [What's new](mac-whatsnew.md)       | 10.7.2 |

Before you start using the client of your choice, there are a few things you'll need to do first.

## Configure your remote PC

Just as you would with a local computer, you'll need to configure your remote computer before you start accessing it with the client.

To configure your remote PC:

1. Check the [supported configuration](remote-desktop-supported-config.md) article to make sure your local PC is compatible with the Remote Desktop client.
2. Follow the instructions in [Allow access to your PC](remote-desktop-allow-access.md) to set up your remote PC and give you the necessary permissions to access the remote PC with the client.

## Remote Desktop client Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme

You can also use features of Remote Desktop clients across platforms by enabling a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme. The [Supported URI attributes](remote-desktop-uri.md) article will tell you about URIs you can use with the iOS, Mac, and Android clients.

## Other resources

If you have any other questions that this article didn't answer, check out the [Remote Desktop client FAQ](remote-desktop-client-faq.yml).
