# Remote Desktop clients for Remote Desktop Services and remote PCs

With Microsoft Remote Desktop clients, you can connect to Remote Desktop Services from Windows Server and remote PCs, and use and control desktops and apps that your admin has made available to you. There are clients available for many different types of devices on different platforms and form factors, such as desktops and laptops, tablets, smartphones, and through a web browser. Using your web browser on desktops and laptops, you can connect without having to download and install any software.

There are many features you can use to enhance your remote experience, such as:

- Multiple monitor support.
- Custom display resolutions.
- Dynamic display resolutions and scaling.
- Device redirection, such as webcams, storage devices, and printers.
- Use apps installed on the remote PC.
- Access files and network resources on the remote PC.
- Leave the apps open when you turn off the client.

Some features are only available with certain clients, so it's important to check [Compare the features of the Remote Desktop clients](remote-desktop-features.md) to understand the differences when connecting to Remote Desktop Services or remote PCs.

> [!TIP]
> You can also use most versions of the Remote Desktop client to also connect to [Azure Virtual Desktop](/azure/virtual-desktop/users/connect-windows?tabs=subscribe), as well as to Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server or to a remote PC. If you want information on Azure Virtual Desktop instead, see [Remote Desktop clients for Azure Virtual Desktop](/azure/virtual-desktop/users/remote-desktop-clients-overview).
