# Remote Desktop Services - planning poster

## Azure Virtual Desktop

You may have heard us talk about a new "modern infrastructure" for Remote Desktop. Maybe you've heard us use the phrase "RDmi." The phrase you need to know is "Azure Virtual Desktop." Learn more at our [Azure Virtual Desktop documentation page](/azure/virtual-desktop/).

The Remote Desktop Services team have created a poster to help you plan, build, and run your Azure Virtual Desktop environment.
