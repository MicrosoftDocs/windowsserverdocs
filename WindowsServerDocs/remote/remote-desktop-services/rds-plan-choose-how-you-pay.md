# Remote Desktop Services - Choose how you pay

>

Choose your licensing based on what makes sense for your company. License per user to enable users to remote on any of their devices in a BYOD scenario. License per device if users share the same devices. If you are a service provider (HSP or MSP) or ISV, choose the per user SALs license for a flexible, pay-as-you-go model.

For more information, check out [License your RDS deployment with client access licenses (CALs)](rds-client-access-license.md).
