# License Remote Desktop session hosts

You can use the information in this article to configure licensing for session hosts on your Remote Desktop Services (RDS) deployments. The process is slightly different depending on which roles you assigned to the session host you're licensing.

## Prerequisites

In order to install licenses for your session hosts, you need a Remote Desktop license server with per-user or per-device client access licenses (CALs) activated.

## Configure licensing for an RDS deployment that includes the RD Connection Broker role

If you need to license session hosts where your RDS deployment doesn't include the connection broker role, you must specify a license server by using group policy either centrally from your Active Directory domain, or locally on each session host. You also need to do specify a license server when using Windows Server with Azure Virtual Desktop.

To specify a license server:

1. On the RD Connection Broker computer, open Server Manager.
2. In Server Manager, select **Remote Desktop Services** > **Overview** > **Edit Deployment Properties** > **RD Licensing**.

3. Select the Remote Desktop licensing mode (either **Per User** or **Per Device**, as appropriate for your deployment).

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If you use domain-joined servers for your RDS deployment, you can use both Per User and Per Device CALs. If you use workgroup servers for your RDS deployment, you have to use Per Device CALs In that case, Per User CALs are not permitted.

4. Specify a license server, and then select **Add**.

## Configure licensing for an RDS deployment that includes only the RD Session Host role and the RD Licensing role

1. Depending on whether you want to configure Group Policy centrally from your domain or locally on each session host:

   - Open the **Group Policy Management Console** (GPMC) and create or edit a policy that targets your session hosts.

   - Open the **Local Group Policy Editor** on the session host.

1. Go to **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Remote Desktop Services** > **Remote Desktop Session Host** > **Licensing**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/rds-license-session-hosts/local-gp-editor-licensing-config.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the list of policies for Remote Desktop licensing. Use the specified Remote Desktop license servers and Set the Remote Desktop licensing mode are highlighted with red borders.":::

1. In the policy list, right-click **Use the specified Remote Desktop license servers**, and then select **Properties**.

1. Select **Enabled**, and then enter the name of the license server under **License servers to use**. If you have more than one license server, use commas to separate their names.

   :::image type="content" source="media/rds-license-session-hosts/local-gp-specify-license-server.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Use the specified Remote Desktop license servers window. The field labeled License servers to use is highlighted with a red border.":::

1. Select **OK**.  

1. In the policy list, right-click **Set the Remote Desktop licensing mode**, and then select **Properties**.

1. Select **Enabled**.

1. Under **Specify the licensing mode for the Remote Desktop Session Host server**, select **Per Device** or **Per User**, as appropriate for your deployment.

   :::image type="content" source="media/rds-license-session-hosts/local-gp-specify-licensing-mode.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Set the Remote Desktop licensing mode window. The drop-down menu for specifying the licensing mode for the RD Session Host server is highlighted with a red border.":::

## Ensure an RD Session Host can access an RD licensing server in the same work group 

This section only applies to work groups. Skip this section if your RD Session Host and RD licensing server are joined to a domain in Active Directory. You can also skip this section if the RD licensing server and RD Session Host server are the same machine. 

After applying the security update for [CVE-2024-38099](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-38099), RD licensing servers enforce that RD Session Host servers present nonanonymous credentials when requesting or querying licenses. To enforce nonanymous credentials exist, confirm that the _NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE_ account under which the Remote Desktop Service runs on the RD Session Host has access to credentials. Configure the machines in a work group using the following steps. 

First, we recommend creating a dedicated user on the RD licensing server: 

1. Connect to the RD licensing server. If doing so remotely, you may need to start the **Remote Desktop Connection** application using the `mstsc.exe /admin` command if the target machine can't contact a RD licensing server. 

1. Once connected, right-click **Start**, then select **Run**, and enter `lusrmgr.msc`. Then press ENTER. 

1. Select **Users** in the left pane. 

1. Open the **Action** menu and select **New User…**. 

1. Choose a username and a unique strong password for the user. Then confirm the password.

1. Uncheck the "User must change password at next logon" checkbox. 

1. Select **Create**. 

Then, on each RD Session Host server that needs to connect to the RD licensing server, add the user: 

1. Connect to the RD Session Host machine. If doing so remotely, you may need to start the **Remote Desktop Connection** application if the target machine can’t contact any RD licensing server. Open **Remote Desktop Connection** as an administrator, or use the command: `mstsc.exe /admin`.

1. Start a Command Prompt as _NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE_. You can do this with [PsExec](/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) from the [Sysinternals Utilities](/sysinternals/downloads/), by running the following command as an administrator:

   ```cmd
   psexec.exe -I -u "NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE" cmd.exe
   ``` 

1. Then, add the hostname or IP address of your licensing server, and a username and password to the licensing server with the following command:

   ```cmd
   cmdkey /add:<NAME-OF-THE-LICENSING-SERVER> /user:<NAME-OF-THE-LICENSING-SERVER>\<USERNAME> /pass
   ```

1. When prompted for the password, enter the password previously selected and press ENTER. 

The RD Session Host should now be able to connect to the RD licensing server. 

Alternatively, the requirement for proper authentication can be disabled on the licensing server. If you would like to disable the enforcement of authentication on your RD licensing server despite the risk, you can modify the registry. 
 
> [!WARNING]
> Disabling the enforcement of authentication on the RD licensing server is not recommended and can result in increased security risks. Use it at your own risk. 
>
> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To update the registry key and value on the RD licensing server: 

1. Start the **Registry Editor**. 

1. Modify the key: `HKLM\ SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TermServLicensing\Parameters` with the following values: 

   - **Name**: DisableWorkgroupAuthEnforcement 

   - **Type**: REG_DWORD 

   - **Data**: 1 

> [!WARNING]
> Future versions of Windows may stop honoring this setting.
