# Optimizing Windows 10, version 2004, for a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) role

This article is intended to provide suggestions for configurations for Windows 10, build 2004, for optimal performance in Virtualized Desktop environments, including Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD). All settings in this guide are suggested optimization settings only and are in no way requirements.

The information in this guide is pertinent to Windows 10, version 2004, operating system (OS) build 19041.

The guiding principles to optimize performance of Windows 10 in a virtual desktop environment are to minimize graphic redraws and “effects”, background activities that have no major benefit to the virtual desktop environment, and generally reduce running processes to the bare minimum. A secondary goal is to reduce disk space usage in the base image to the bare minimum.  With virtual desktop implementations, the smallest possible base, or “gold” image size, can slightly reduce memory utilization on the host system, as well as a small reduction in overall network operations required to deliver the desktop environment to the consumer.

No optimizations should reduce the user experience.  Each optimization setting has been carefully reviewed to ensure that there is no appreciable degradation to the user experience.

> [!NOTE]
> The settings in this article can be applied to other Windows 10 installations, such as version 1909, physical devices, or other virtual machines. There are no recommendations in this article that should affect supportability of Windows 10 in a virtual desktop environment.

## VDI Optimization Principles

A “full” virtual desktop environment can present a complete desktop session, including applications, to a computer user over a network. The network delivery vehicle can be an on-premises network, the Internet, or both. Some implementations of virtual desktop environments use a “base” operating system image, which then becomes the basis for the desktops subsequently presented to the users for work. There are variations of virtual desktop implementations such as “persistent”, “non-persistent”, and “desktop session”. The persistent type preserves changes to the virtual desktop operating system from one session to the next. The non-persistent type does not preserve changes to the virtual desktop operating system from one session to the next. To the user this desktop is little different than other virtual or physical device, other than it is accessed over a network.

The optimization settings could take place on a reference machine.  A virtual machine (VM) would be an ideal place to build the VM, because state can be saved, checkpoints can be made, backups can be made, etc. A default OS installation is performed to the base VM. That base VM is then optimized by removing unneeded apps, installing Windows updates, installing other updates, deleting temporary files, applying settings, etc.

There are other types of virtual desktop technology such as Remote Desktop Session (RDS) and the recently released Microsoft Azure [Windows Virtual Desktop](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/). An in-depth discussion regarding these technologies is outside the scope of this article. This article focuses on the Windows base image settings, without reference to other factors in the environment such as host hardware optimization.

Security and stability are among the highest priorities for Microsoft when it comes to products and services. In the virtual desktop realm, security is not handled much differently than physical devices. Enterprise customers may choose to utilize the built-in to Windows services of Windows Security, which comprises a suite of services that work well connected or not connected to the Internet. For those virtual desktop environments not connected to the Internet, security signatures can be downloaded proactively several times per day, because Microsoft may release more than one signature update per day. Those signatures can then be provided to the virtual desktop devices and scheduled to be installed during production, regardless of persistent or non-persistent. That way the VM protection is as current as possible.

There are some security settings that are not applicable to virtual desktop environments that are not connected to the Internet, and thus not able to participate in cloud-enabled security. There are other settings that “normal” Windows devices may utilize such as Cloud Experience, The Windows Store, etc. Removing access to unused features reduces footprint, network bandwidth, and attack surface.

Regarding updates, Windows 10 utilizes a monthly update rhythm. In some cases virtual desktop administrators control the process of updating through a process of shutting down VMs based on a “master” or “gold” image, unseal that image which is read-only, patch the image, then reseal it and bring it back into production. Therefore, there is no need to have virtual desktop devices checking Windows Update. There are cases however, as in the case of persistent “personal” virtual desktop devices, where normal patching procedures take place. In some cases, Windows Update can be utilized. In some cases, Intune could be utilized.  In some cases Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (formerly SCCM) is utilized to handle update and other package delivery.  It is up to each organization to determine the best approach to updating virtual desktop devices, while reducing overhead cycles.

The local policy settings, as well as many other settings in this guide can be overridden with domain-based policy.  It is recommended to go through the policy settings thoroughly and remove or not use any that are not desired or applicable to your environment.  The settings listed in this document try to achieve the best balance of performance optimization in virtual desktop environments, while maintaining a quality user experience.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a set of scripts available at GitHub.com, that will do all the work items documented in this paper. The Internet URL for the optimization scripts can be found at [https://github.com/The-Virtual-Desktop-Team/Virtual-Desktop-Optimization-Tool](https://github.com/The-Virtual-Desktop-Team/Virtual-Desktop-Optimization-Tool).  This script was designed to be easily customizable for your environment and requirements. The main code is PowerShell, and the work is done by calling input files, which are plain text (now .JSON), with also Local Group Policy Object (LGPO) tool export files. These text files contain lists of the apps to be removed, services to be disabled, and so on. If you do not wish to remove a particular app or disable a particular service, you can edit the corresponding text file and remove the item you do not want acted upon.  Finally, there is an export of local policy settings that can be imported into your environment machines. It is better to have some of the settings within the base image, than to have the settings applied through group policy, as some of the settings take effect on the next restart or when a component is first used.


### Persistent Virtual Desktop Environments

Persistent virtual desktop is at the basic level, a device that saves operating system state in between reboots. Other software layers of the virtual desktop solution provide the users easy and seamless access to their assigned VMs, often with a single sign-on solution.  

There are several different implementations of persistent virtual desktop.

- Traditional virtual machine (VM), where the VM has its own virtual disk file, starts up normally, and saves changes from one session to the next. The difference is how the user accesses this VM. There may be a web portal the user logs into that automatically directs the user to their one or more assigned virtual desktop devices (VMs).
- Image-based persistent VM, optionally with personal virtual disks (PVD). In this type of implementation there is a base/gold image on one or more host servers. A VM is created, and one or more virtual disks are created and assigned to this disk for persistent storage.
  - When the VM is started, a copy of the base image is read into the memory space of that VM. At the same time, a persistent virtual disk assigned to that VM, with any previous OS deltas is merged through a complex process.
  - Changes such as event log writes, log writes, etc. are redirected to the read/write virtual disk assigned to that VM.
  - In this circumstance, OS and app servicing may operate normally, using traditional servicing software such as Windows Server Update Services, or other management technologies.
- The difference between a persistent virtual desktop device and a “normal” virtual desktop device” is the relationship to the master/gold image. At some point updates must be applied to the master. It is at this point where organizations decide how the user persistent changes are handled. In some cases, the disk with the user changes is discarded and/or reset.  It may also be that the changes the user makes to the machine are kept through monthly Quality Updates, and the base is reset following a Feature Update.

### Non-Persistent Virtual Desktop Environments

When a non-persistent virtual desktop implementation is based on a base or “gold” image, the optimizations are mostly performed in the base image, and then through local settings and local policies.

With image-based non-persistent (NP) virtual desktop environments, the base image is read-only. When a NP virtual desktop device (VM) is started, a copy of the base image is streamed to the VM.  Activity that occurs during startup and thereafter until the next reboot is redirected to a temporary location. Usually the users are provided network locations to store their data.  In some cases, the user’s profile is merged with the standard VM to provide the user their settings.

One important aspect of NP virtual desktop that is based on a single image, is servicing.  Updates to the operating system (OS) and components of the OS are delivered usually once per month.  With image based virtual desktop environment, there are a set of processes that must be performed to get updates to the image:

- On a given host, all the VMs on that host, based from the base image must be shut down / turned off. This means the users are redirected to other VMs.
	-In some implementations, this is referred to as “draining”.  The virtual machine or session host, when set to draining mode, stops accepting new requests, but continues servicing users currently connected to the device.
	-In draining mode, when the last user logs off the device, that device is then ready for servicing operations.
-The base image is then opened and started up.  All maintenance activities are then performed, such as OS updates, .NET updates, app updates, etc.
-Any new settings that need to be applied are applied at this time.
-Any other maintenance is performed at this time.
-The base image is then shut down.
-The base image is sealed and set to go back into production.
-Users are allowed to log back on.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows 10 performs a set of maintenance tasks, automatically, on a periodic basis. There is a scheduled task that is set to run at 3:00 AM every day by default. This scheduled task performs a list of tasks, including Windows Update cleanup. You can view all the categories of maintenance that take place automatically with this PowerShell command:
>
```PowerShell
Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object {$_.Settings.MaintenanceSettings}
```
>

One of the challenges with non-persistent virtual desktop is that when a user logs off, nearly all the operating system (OS) activity is discarded.  The user’s profile and/or state may be saved to a centralized location, but the virtual machine itself discards nearly all changes that were made since last boot. Therefore, optimizations intended for a Windows computer that saves state from one session to the next are not applicable.

Depending on the architecture of virtual desktop device, things like PreFetch and SuperFetch are not going to help from one session to the next, as all the optimizations are discarded on VM restart. Indexing may be a partial waste of resources, as would be any disk optimizations such as a traditional defragmentation.

> [!NOTE]
> If preparing an image using virtualization, and if connected to the Internet during image creation process, on first logon you should postpone Feature Updates by going to ‘**Settings**’, ‘**Windows Update**’.

### To Sysprep or not Sysprep

Windows 10 has a built-in capability called the ‘[System Preparation Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep--system-preparation--overview)’, (AKA Sysprep).  The Sysprep tool is used to prepare a customized Windows 10 image for duplication. The Sysprep process assures the resulting OS is properly unique to run in production.

There are reasons for and against running Sysprep. In the case of virtual desktop environments, you may want the ability to customize the default user profile which would be used as the profile template for subsequent users that log on using this image. You may have apps that you want installed, but also able to control per-app settings.

The alternative is to use a standard .ISO to install from, possibly using an unattended installation answer file, and a task sequence to install applications or remove applications.  You can also use a task sequence to set local policy settings in the image, perhaps using the [Local Group Policy Object Utility (LGPO)](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/secguide/2016/01/21/lgpo-exe-local-group-policy-object-utility-v1-0/) tool.

For information about image preparation for Azure, see the following article:
[Prepare a Windows VHD or VHDX to upload to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/prepare-for-upload-vhd-image)

### Supportability

Anytime that Windows defaults are changed, questions arise regarding supportability. Once a virtual desktop image (VM or session) is customized, every change made to the image needs to be tracked in a change log. If a time comes to troubleshoot, often an image can be isolated in a pool and configured for problem analysis. Once a problem has been tracked to root cause, that change can then be rolled out to the test environment first, and ultimately to the production workload.

This document intentionally avoids touching system services, policies, or tasks that affect security. After that comes Windows servicing. The ability to service virtual desktop images outside of maintenance windows is removed, as maintenance windows are when most servicing events take place in virtual desktop environments, except for security software updates. Microsoft has published guidance for Windows Security in virtual desktop environments, here:

**Microsoft**: [Deployment guide for Windows Defender Antivirus in a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/deployment-vdi-windows-defender-antivirus)

Please consider supportability when altering default Windows settings. Occasionally difficult to solve problems arise when altering system services, policies, or scheduled tasks, in the name of hardening, “lightening”, etc. Please consult the Microsoft Knowledge Base for current known issues regarding altered default settings. The guidance in this document, and the associated script on GitHub will be maintained with respect to known issues, if any arise. In addition you can report issues in a number of ways to Microsoft.

You can use your favorite search engine with the terms ""start value" site:support.microsoft.com" to bring up known issues regarding default start values for services and so on.

You may note that this document and the associated scripts on GitHub do not modify any default permissions. If you are interested in increasing your security settings in a supported and robust manner, start with the project known as “**AaronLocker**”, which can be found at this Internet location:

### Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application cleanup

One of the goals of a virtual desktop image is to be as light as possible with respect to persistent storage. One way to reduce the size of the image is to remove UWP applications (apps) that will not be used in the environment. With UWP apps, there are the main application files, also known as the payload. There is a small amount of data stored in each user’s profile for application specific settings. There is also a small amount of data in the ‘All User’s’ profile.

In addition, all UWP apps are registered at either the user or machine level at some point after startup for the device, and login for the user. The UWP apps, which include the Start Menu and the Windows Shell, perform various tasks at or after installation, and again when a user logs in for the first time, and to a lesser extent at subsequent logins.  For all UWP apps, there are occasional evaluations that take place, such as:

- Is the app current...does it need an update?
- The app, if pinned to the Start Menu, might have live tile data to download
- Does the app have a cache of data that needs to be updated, such as maps or weather?
- Does the app have persistent data from the user's profile that needs to be presented at login (ex. Sticky Notes)
 
With a default installation of Windows 10, not all UWP apps may be used by an organization. Therefore, if those apps are removed, there are less evaluations to take place…less caching, etc.  The second method here is to direct Windows to disable “consumer experiences”.  This reduces Store activity by having to check for every user what apps are installed, what apps are available, and then to start downloading some UWP apps.  The performance savings can be significant when there are hundreds or thousands of users, all start work at approximately the same time, or even starting work at rolling times across time zones.

Connectivity and timing are important factors when it comes to UWP app cleanup. If you deploy your base image to a device with no network connectivity, Windows 10 cannot connect to the Microsoft Store and download apps and try to install them while you are trying to uninstall them. This might be a good strategy to allow you time to customize your image, and then update what remains at a later stage of the image creation process.

If you modify your base .WIM that you use to install Windows 10 and remove unneeded UWP apps from the .WIM before you install, the apps will not be installed from the beginning and your subsequent profile creation times will be shorter.  There is a link later in this section with information on how to remove UWP apps from your installation .WIM file.

A good strategy for the virtual desktop environment is to provision the apps you want in the base image, then limit or block access to the Microsoft Store afterward. Store apps are updated periodically in the background on normal computers. The UWP apps can be updated during the maintenance window when other updates are applied. There is a great paper on this topic, recently published, and available here:

Microsoft: [Universal Windows Platform Apps](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenapp-and-xendesktop/current-release/manage-deployment/applications-manage/universal-apps.html)

#### Delete the payload of UWP apps

UWP apps that are not needed are still in the file system consuming a small amount of disk space. For apps that will never be needed, the payload of unwanted UWP apps can be removed from the base image using PowerShell commands.  If you delete UWP app payloads out of the installation .WIM file using the links provided later in this section, you can start from the beginning with a very slim list of UWP apps.
 
Run the following command to enumerate provisioned UWP apps from a running OS, as in this truncated example output from PowerShell:

```powershell
    Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online

    DisplayName  : Microsoft.3DBuilder
    Version      : 13.0.10349.0  
    Architecture : neutral
    ResourceId   : \~ 
    PackageName  : Microsoft.3DBuilder_13.0.10349.0_neutral_\~_8wekyb3d8bbwe
    Regions      :

    DisplayName  : Microsoft.Appconnector
    Version      : 2015.707.550  
    Architecture : neutral
    ResourceId   : \~ 
    PackageName  : Microsoft.Appconnector_2015.707.550.0_neutral_\~_8wekyb3d8bbwe
    Regions      :
    ...
```
UWP apps that are provisioned to a system can be removed during OS installation as part of a task sequence, or later after the OS is installed. This may be the preferred method because it makes the overall process of creating and/or maintaining an image modular. Once you develop the scripts, if something changes in a subsequent build you edit an existing script rather than repeat the process from scratch. Here are some links to information on this topic:

- Microsoft: [Removing Windows 10 in-box apps during a task sequence](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mniehaus/2015/11/11/removing-windows-10-in-box-apps-during-a-task-sequence/)
- Microsoft: [Removing Built-in apps from Windows 10 WIM-File with PowerShell - Version 1.3](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Removing-Built-in-apps-65dc387b)
- Microsoft: [Windows 10 1607: Keeping apps from coming back when deploying the feature update](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mniehaus/2016/08/23/windows-10-1607-keeping-apps-from-coming-back-when-deploying-the-feature-update/)
- Microsoft: [Removing Windows 10 in-box apps during a task sequence](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mniehaus/2015/11/11/removing-windows-10-in-box-apps-during-a-task-sequence/)

Then run the Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage PowerShell command to remove UWP app payloads is as follows:

```powershell
Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online - PackageName MyAppxPackage 
```

As a final note on this topic, each UWP app should be evaluated for applicability in each unique environment. You will want to install a default installation of Windows 10 2004, then note which apps are running and consuming memory. For example, you may want to consider removing apps that start automatically, or apps that automatically display information on the Start Menu, such as Weather and News, and that may not be of use in your environment.

> [!NOTE] 
> If utilizing the scripts from GitHub, you can easily control which apps are removed before running the script. After downloading the script files, locate the file ‘AppxPackage.json’, edit that file, and remove entries for apps that you want to keep, such as Calculator, Sticky Notes, etc.


## Windows Optional Features cleanup

### Managing Optional Features with PowerShell

Microsoft: [https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/39386.windows-10-managing-optional-features-with-powershell.aspx](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/39386.windows-10-managing-optional-features-with-powershell.aspx)

You can manage Windows Optional Features using PowerShell. To enumerate currently installed Windows Features, run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online
```

Using PowerShell, an enumerated Windows ZOptional Feature can be configured as enabled or disabled, as in the following example:

```powershell
Enabled-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "DirectPlay" -All
```

Examples of disabling features in the virtual desktop image:

```powershell
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "WindowsMediaPlayer"
```

Next, you may want to remove teh WIndows Media Player package.

```powershell

PS C:\> Get-WindowsPackage -Online -PackageName *media*

PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-WindowsPackage -Online -PackageName *media*

```

If you want to remove the Windows Media Player package (to free up about 60 MB disk space), you can run this command:

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32> Remove-WindowsPackage -PackageName Microsoft-Windows-MediaPlayer-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.19041.153 -Online

Path          :
Online        : True
RestartNeeded : False
```

### Enable of Disable Windows Features Using DISM

You can use the built-in Dism.exe tool to enumerate and control Windows Optional Features. A Dism.exe script could be developed and run during an operating system installation task sequence. The Windows technology involved is called Features on Demand. See the following article for more about Features on Demand in Windows:

Microsoft: [Features on Demand](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/features-on-demand-v2--capabilities)

### Default User Settings

There are customizations that can be made to a Windows registry file called ‘C:\Users\Default\NTUSER.DAT’. Any settings made to this file will be applied to any subsequent user profiles created from a machine running this image. You can control which settings you wish to apply to the default user profile, by editing the file ‘**DefaultUserSettings.txt**’.

To reduce the transmitting of graphical data over the virtual desktop infrastructure, you can set the default background to a solid color instead of the default Windows 10 image. You can also set the logon screen to be a solid color, as well as turn off the opaque blurring effect on logon.

The following settings are applied to the default user profile registry hive, mainly to reduce animations. If some or all of these settings are not desired, delete out the settings that you do not wish to have applied to new user profiles based on this image. The goal with these settings is to enable the following equivalent settings:

![Performance Options](media/rds-vdi-recommendations-2002-Performance.png)

And, new to this version of settings is a method to disable the following two privacy settings for any user profile created after this optimization has been run:

![](media/PrivacySettings.png)

The following are the optimization settings applied to the default user profile registry hive to optimize performance.  Note that this operation is performed by first loading the default user profile registry hive ‘**NTUser.dat**’, as the ephemeral key name ‘**Temp**’, and then making the below listed modifications:

```
Load HKLM\Temp C:\Users\Default\NTUSER.DAT

Another series of default user settings recently added is to disable several Windows apps from starting and running in the background.  While not significant on a single device, Windows 10 starts up a number of processes for each user session on a given device (host).  The Skype app is one example, and Microsoft Edge is another.  The settings included turn off several apps from being able to run in the background.  If this functionality is desired as it is, just delete out the lines in the ‘DefaultUserSettings.txt’ that include the app names ‘**Windows.Photos**’, ‘**SkypeApp**’, ‘**YourPhone**’, and/or ‘**MicrosoftEdge**’.

### Local Policy Settings

Many optimizations for Windows 10 in a virtual desktop environment can be made using Windows policy. The settings listed in the table in this section can be applied locally to the base/gold image. Then if the equivalent settings are not specified in any other way, such as group policy, the settings would still apply.

Note that some decisions may be based on the specifics of the environment.

- Is the virtual desktop environment allowed to access the Internet?
- Is the virtual desktop solution persistent or non-persistent?

The following settings were chosen to not counter or conflict with any setting that has anything to do with security. These settings were chosen to remove settings or disable functionality that may not be applicable to virtual desktop environments.

| Policy Setting | Item | Sub-item | Possible setting and comments|
| -------------- | ---- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Local Computer Policy \\ Computer Configuration \\ Windows Settings \\ Security Settings | | | |

### System services

If considering disabling system services to conserve resources, great care should be taken that the service being considered is not in some way a component of some other service. In this paper and with the available GitHub scripts, some services are not in the list because they cannot be disabled in a supported manner.

Most of these recommendations mirror recommendations for Windows Server 2016, installed with the Desktop Experience, per the following Microsoft article:

**Microsoft**: [Guidance on disabling system services on Windows Server 2016 with Desktop Experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-services/security-guidelines-for-disabling-system-services-in-windows-server)

Many services that may seem like good candidates to disable are set to manual service start type. This means that the service will not automatically start and is not started unless process or event triggers a request to the service being consider for disabling. Services that are already set to start type manual are usually not listed here.

> [!NOTE] You can enumerate running services with this PowerShell sample code, outputting only the service short name:
```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq 'Running'} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
```

#### Per-user services in Windows
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/application-management/per-user-services-in-windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/application-management/per-user-services-in-windows)
Per-user services are services that are created when a user signs into Windows or Windows Server and are stopped and deleted when that user signs out. These services run in the security context of the user account - this provides better resource management than the previous approach of running these kinds of services in Explorer, associated with a preconfigured account, or as tasks.

If you intend to change a service start value, the preferred method is to open an elevated .CMD prompt and run the Service Control Manager tool ‘SC.EXE’. You can find more information on using ‘SC.EXE’ at this Internet location:

**Microsoft**: [SC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/cc754599(v=ws.11))

### Scheduled tasks
Like other items in Windows, ensure an item is not needed before disabling a scheduled task.  Some tasks in virtual desktop environments, such as “**StartComponentCleanup**”, may not be desirable to run in production, but may be good to run during a maintenance window on the “gold image” (reference image).

The following list of tasks are those that perform optimizations or data collections on computers that maintain their state across reboots. When a virtual desktop device reboots and discards all changes since last boot, optimizations intended for physical computers are not helpful.

You can get all the current scheduled tasks, including descriptions, with the following PowerShell code:

```powershell
  Get-ScheduledTask | Select-Object -Property TaskPath,TaskName,State,Description
```
> [!NOTE] There are several tasks that cannot be disabled via script, even when run elevated. The recommendations here, and in the GitHub scripts do not attempt to disable tasks that cannot be disabled via script.

### Apply Windows (and other) updates
Whether from Microsoft Update, or from your internal resources, apply available updates including Windows Defender signatures. This is a good time to apply other available updates including Microsoft Office if installed, and other software updates. If PowerShell will remain in the image you can download the latest available help for PowerShell by running the command ‘Update-Help’.

#### Servicing OS and apps
At some point during the image optimization process available Windows updates should be applied. There is a setting in Windows 10 update settings that can provide additional updates:

![Additional updates](media/rds-vdi-recommendations-1909/servicing.png)

This would be a good setting in case you are going to install Microsoft applications such as Microsoft Office to the base image.  That way Office is up to date when the image is put in service. There are also .NET updates and certain third-party components such as Adobe that have updates available through Windows Update.

One very important consideration for non-persistent virtual desktop devices are security updates, including security software definition files.  These updates may be released once or even more than once per day.

For Windows Defender it may be best to allow the updates to occur, even on non-persistent virtual desktop environments.  The updates are going to apply nearly every logon session, but the updates are small and should not be a problem.  Plus, the device won’t be behind on updates because only the latest available will apply.  The same may be true for third-party definition files.

**Note** that Store apps (UWP apps) update through the Windows Store.  Modern versions of Office such as Office 365 update through their own mechanisms when directly connected to the Internet, or via management technologies when not.

#### Windows system startup event traces (AutoLoggers)
Windows is configured, by default, to collect and save diagnostic data. The purpose is to enable diagnostics, or to record data if further troubleshooting is necessary. Automatic system traces can be found at the location depicted in the following illustration:

![System Traces](media/rds-vdi-recommendations-1909/system-traces.png)

Some of the traces displayed under **Event Trace Sessions** and **Startup Event Trace Sessions** can't and should not be stopped. Others, such as the ‘WiFiSession’ trace can be stopped. To stop a running trace under **Event Trace Sessions** right-click the trace and then click ‘Stop’. Use the following procedure to prevent the traces from starting automatically on startup:

1. Click the **Startup Event Trace Sessions** folder.

2. Locate the trace of interest, and then double-click that trace.

3. Click the **Trace Session** tab.

4. Click the box labeled **Enabled** to remove the check mark.

5. Click **Ok**.

The following are some system traces that could be considered for disablement for virtual desktop environments:

#### Windows Defender optimization in the virtual desktop environment
Microsoft has recently published documentation regarding Windows Defender in a virtual desktop environment, at this location:

[Deployment guide for Windows Defender Antivirus in a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/deployment-vdi-windows-defender-antivirus)

The above article contains procedures to service the ‘gold’ virtual desktop image, and how to maintain the virtual desktop clients as they are running. To reduce network bandwidth when virtual desktop devices need to update their Windows Defender signatures, stagger reboots, and schedule reboots during off hours where possible. The Windows Defender signature updates can be contained internally on file shares, and where practical, have those files shares on the same or close networking segments as the virtual desktop devices.

#### Client network performance tuning by registry settings
There are some registry settings that can increase network performance. This is especially important in environments where the virtual desktop device or physical computer has a workload that is primarily network based.  The settings in this section are recommended to tune performance for the networking workload profile, by setting up additional buffering and caching of things like directory entries and so on.

> [!NOTE]Some settings in this section are registry-based only and should be incorporated in the base image before the image is deployed for production use.

The following settings are documented in the [Windows Server 2016 Performance Tuning Guideline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/performance-tuning/) information, published on Microsoft.com by the Windows Product Group.

#### DisableBandwidthThrottling

`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\DisableBandwidthThrottling`

Applies to Windows 10. The default is **0**. By default, the SMB redirector throttles throughput across high-latency network connections, in some cases to avoid network-related timeouts. Setting this registry value to 1 disables this throttling, enabling higher file transfer throughput over high-latency network connections. Consider setting this value to **1**.

#### FileInfoCacheEntriesMax

`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\FileInfoCacheEntriesMax`
Applies to Windows 10. The default is **64**, with a valid range of 1 to 65536. This value is used to determine the amount of file metadata that can be cached by the client. Increasing the value can reduce network traffic and increase performance when many files are accessed. Try increasing this value to **1024**.

#### DirectoryCacheEntriesMax

`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\DirectoryCacheEntriesMax`

Applies to Windows 10. The default is **16**, with a valid range of 1 to 4096. This value is used to determine the amount of directory information that can be cached by the client. Increasing the value can reduce network traffic and increase performance when large directories are accessed. Consider increasing this value to **1024**.

#### FileNotFoundCacheEntriesMax

`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\FileNotFoundCacheEntriesMax`

Applies to Windows 10. The default is **128**, with a valid range of 1 to 65536. This value is used to determine the amount of file name information that can be cached by the client. Increasing the value can reduce network traffic and increase performance when many file names are accessed. Consider increasing this value to **2048**.

#### DormantFileLimit

`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\DormantFileLimit`

Applies to Windows 10. The default is **1023**. This parameter specifies the maximum number of files that should be left open on a shared resource after the application has closed the file. Where many thousands of clients are connecting to SMB servers, consider reducing this value to **256**.

You can configure many of these SMB settings by using the [Set-SmbClientConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/smbshare/set-smbclientconfiguration?view=win10-ps) and [Set-SmbServerConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/smbshare/set-smbserverconfiguration?view=win10-ps) Windows PowerShell cmdlets. Registry-only settings can be configured by using Windows PowerShell as well, as in the following example:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters" RequireSecuritySignature -Value 0 -Force
```

#### Additional settings from the Windows Restricted Traffic Limited Functionality Baseline guidance
Microsoft has released a baseline, created using the same procedures as the [Windows Security Baselines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/windows-security-baselines), for environments that are either not connected directly to the Internet, or wish to reduce data sent to Microsoft and other services.

The [Windows Restricted Traffic Limited Functionality Baseline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/manage-connections-from-windows-operating-system-components-to-microsoft-services) settings are called out in the group policy table with an asterisk.

#### Disk cleanup (including using the Disk Cleanup Wizard)

Disk cleanup can be especially helpful with gold/master image virtual desktop implementations. After the gold/master image is prepared, updated, and configured, one of the last tasks to perform is disk cleanup.  The optimization scripts on Github.com have PowerShell code to perform common disk cleanup tasks

> [!NOTE]
Disk cleanup settings and are in the Settings category ‘System’ called ‘Storage’. The technology ‘Storage Sense’ by default runs when a low disk free space threshold is reached.
Microsoft has provided guidance on using ‘Storage Sense’ with Azure custom VHD images.  You can locate that guidance here:<p>
[Prepare and customize a master VHD image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/set-up-customize-master-image)<p>“For Windows Virtual Desktop session host that use Windows 10 Enterprise or Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, we recommend disabling Storage Sense. You can disable Storage Sense in the Settings menu under **Storage**”

Here are suggestions for various disk cleanup tasks.  These should all be tested before implementing:

1. Storage Sense may be utilized manually or automatically.  For more information on Storage Sense, see this article:
Use OneDrive and Storage Sense in Windows 10 to manage disk space
2. Manually cleanup temporary files and logs.  From an elevated command prompt:
   1. Del C:\*.tmp /s
   2. C:\*.etl /s
   3. C:\*.evtx /s

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path c:\ -Include *.tmp, *.dmp, *.etl, *.evtx, thumbcache*.db, *.log -File -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Remove-Item -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Remove-Item -Path $env:ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\Temp\* -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Remove-Item -Path $env:ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportArchive\* -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Remove-Item -Path $env:ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportQueue\* -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Clear-RecycleBin -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Clear-BCCache -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

```

3. Delete any unused profiles on the system
    1. wmic path win32_UserProfile where LocalPath="C:\\users\\<users>" Delete
