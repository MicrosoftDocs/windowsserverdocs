# Remote Desktop Services - Multi-Factor Authentication

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

Leverage the power of Active Directory with Multi-Factor Authentication to enforce high security protection of your business resources.

For your end-users connecting to their desktops and applications, the experience is similar to what they already face as they perform a second authentication measure to connect to the desired resource:
- Launch a desktop or RemoteApp from an RDP file or through a Remote Desktop client application
- Upon connecting to the RD Gateway for secure, remote access, receive an SMS or mobile application MFA challenge
- Correctly authenticate and get connected to their resource!

For more details on the configuration process, check out [Integrate your Remote Desktop Gateway infrastructure using the Network Policy Server (NPS) extension and Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/nps-extension-remote-desktop-gateway).
