# Optimizing Windows 10, version 1803, for a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) role

This article helps you choose settings for Windows 10,  version 1803 (build 17134) that should result in the best performance in a Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure
(VDI) environment. All settings in this guide are *recommendations to be considered* and are in no way requirements.

In a VDI environment the key ways to optimize Windows 10 performance are to minimize app graphic redraws, background activities that have no major benefit to the VDI environment, and generally reduce running processes to the bare minimum. A secondary goal is to reduce disk space usage in the base image to the bare minimum. With VDI implementations, the smallest possible base, or “gold” image size, can slightly reduce memory usage on the hypervisor, as well as a small reduction in overall network operations required to deliver the desktop image to the consumer.

> [!NOTE]  
> Settings recommended here can be applied to other installation of Windows 10, version 1803, including those on physical or other virtual devices. No recommendations in this topic should affect  the supportability of Windows 10, version 1803.

> [!TIP]  
> A script that implements the optimizations discussed in this topic--as well as a GPO export file that you can import with **LGPO.exe**--is available at [TheVDIGuys](https://github.com//TheVDIGuys) on GitHub.

## VDI optimization principles

A VDI environment presents a full desktop session, including applications, to a computer user over a network. VDI environments usually use a base operating system image, which then becomes the basis for the desktops subsequently presented to the users for work. There are variations of VDI implementations such as “persistent”, “non-persistent”, and “desktop session.” The persistent type preserves changes to the VDI desktop operating system from one session to the next. The non-persistent type does not preserve changes to the VDI desktop operating system from one session to the next. To the user this desktop is little different than other virtual or physical device, other than it is accessed over a network.

The optimization settings would take place on a reference device. A VM is an ideal place to build the image, because you can save the state, make checkpoints and backups can be made, and other useful tasks. Start by installing default operating system on the base VM, and then optimize the base VM for VDI use by removing unneeded apps, installing Windows updates, installing other updates, deleting temporary files, applying settings, etc.

There are other types of VDI such as persistent and Remote Desktop Services (RDS). An in-depth discussion regarding these technologies is outside the scope of this topic, which focuses on the Windows base image settings with reference to other factors in the environment such as host optimization.

### Persistent VDI

Persistent VDI is, at the basic level, a VM that saves operating system state in between restarts. Other software layers of the VDI solution provide the users easy and seamless access to their assigned VMs, often with a single sign-on solution.

There are several different implementations of persistent VDI:

-   Traditional virtual machine, where the VM has its own virtual disk file, starts up normally, saves changes from one session to the next, and is essentially just a normal VM. The difference is how the user accesses this VM. There might be a web portal the user logs into that automatically directs the user to their one or more assigned VDI VMs.

-   Image-based persistent virtual machine, with personal virtual disks. In this type of implementation there is a base/gold image on one or more host servers. A VM is created, and one or more virtual disks are created and assigned to this disk for persistent storage.

    -   When the VM is started, a copy of the base image is read into the memory of the VM. At the same time, a persistent virtual disk assigned to that VM, with any previous operating system changes merged through a complex process.

    -   Changes such as event log writes, log writes, etc. are redirected to the read/write virtual disk assigned to that VM.

    -   In this circumstance, operating system and app servicing might operate normally, using traditional servicing software such as Windows Server Update Services or other management technologies.

### Non-Persistent VDI

When a non-persistent VDI implementation is based on a base or “gold” image, the optimizations are mostly performed in the base image, and then through local settings and local policies.

With image-based non-persistent VDI, the base image is read-only. When a non-persistent VDI VM is started, a copy of the base image is streamed to the VM. Activity that occurs during startup and thereafter until the next reboot is redirected to a temporary location. Usually the users are provided network locations to store their data. In some cases, the user's profile is merged with the standard VM to provide the user their settings.

One important aspect of non-persitent VDI that is based on a single image is servicing. Updates to the operating system are delivered usually once per month.
With image-based VDI, there is a set of processes to perform in order to get updates to the image:

-   On a given host, all the VMs on that host that are derived from the base image must be shut down or turned off. This means the users are redirected to other VMs.

-   The base image is then opened and started up. All maintenance activities are then performed, such as operating system updates, .NET updates, app updates, etc.

-   Any new settings that need to be applied are applied at this time.

-   Any other maintenance is performed at this time.

-   The base image is then shut down.

-   The base image is sealed and set to go back into production.

-   Users are allowed to log back on.

> [!NOTE]  
> Windows 10 performs a set of maintenance tasks automatically, on a periodic basis. There is a scheduled task that is set to run at 3:00 AM local time every day by default. This scheduled task performs a list of tasks, including Windows Update cleanup. You can view all the categories of maintenance that take place automatically with this PowerShell command:
>
>```powershell
>Get-ScheduledTask | ? {$_.Settings.MaintenanceSettings}
>```
>

One of the challenges with non-persistent VDI is that when a user logs off, nearly all the operating system activity is discarded. The user's profile and or state might be
saved, but the virtual machine itself discards nearly all changes that were made since the last boot. Therefore, optimizations intended for a Windows computer that saves state from one session to the next are not applicable.

Depending on the architecture of VDI VM, things like PreFetch and SuperFetch are not going to help from one session to the next, as all the optimizations are discarded on VM restart. Indexing might be a partial waste of resources, as would be any disk optimizations such as a traditional defragmentation.

### To Sysprep or not Sysprep

Windows 10 has a built-in capability called the [System Preparation Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep--system-preparation--overview),
(often abbreviated to "Sysprep"). The Sysprep tool is used to prepare a customized Windows 10 image for duplication. The Sysprep process assures the resulting operating system is properly unique to run in production.

There are reasons for and against running Sysprep. In the case of VDI, you might want the ability to customize the default user profile which would be used as the profile template for subsequent users that log on using this image. You might have apps that you want installed, but also able to control per-app settings.

The alternative is to use a standard .ISO to install from, possibly using an unattended installation answer file, and a task sequence to install applications or remove applications. You can also use a task sequence to set local policy settings in the image, perhaps using the [Local Group Policy Object Utility (LGPO)](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/secguide/2016/01/21/lgpo-exe-local-group-policy-object-utility-v1-0/)
tool.

### Universal Windows Platform app cleanup

One of the goals of a VDI image is to be as small as possible. One way to reduce the size of the image is to remove UWP applications that will not be used in the environment. With UWP apps, there are the main application files, also known as the payload. There is a small amount of data stored in each user's profile for application specific settings. There is also a small amount of data in the All Users profile.

Connectivity and timing are everything when it comes to UWP app cleanup. If you deploy your base image to either a device with no network connectivity, Windows 10 cannot connect to the Microsoft Store and download apps and try to install them while you are trying to uninstall them.

If you modify your base .WIM that you use to install Windows 10 and remove unneeded UWP apps from the .WIM before you install, the apps will not be installed to begin with and your profile creation times should be shorter. Later in this section, you'll find information on how to remove UWP apps from your installation .WIM file.

A good strategy for VDI is to provision the apps you want in the base image, then limit or block access to the Microsoft Store afterward. Store apps are updated periodically in the background on normal computers. The UWP apps can be updated during the maintenance window when other updates are applied. 

#### Delete the payload of UWP apps

UWP apps that are not needed are still in the file system consuming a small amount of disk space. For apps that will never be needed, the payload of unwanted UWP apps can be removed from the base image using PowerShell commands.

In fact, if you remove those from the installation .WIM file using the links provided later in this section, you should be able to start from the beginning with a very slim list of UWP apps.

Run the following command to enumerate provisioned UWP apps from a running Windows 10 operating system, as in this truncated example output from PowerShell:

```powershell

    Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online 

    DisplayName  : Microsoft.3DBuilder
    Version      : 13.0.10349.0  
    Architecture : neutral
    ResourceId   : \~ 
    PackageName  : Microsoft.3DBuilder_13.0.10349.0_neutral_\~_8wekyb3d8bbwe 
    Regions      : 
    ...
```


UWP apps that are provisioned to a system can be removed during operating system installation as part of a task sequence, or later after the operating system is installed. This might be the
preferred method because it makes the overall process of creating or maintaining an image modular. Once you develop the scripts, if something changes in a subsequent build you edit an existing script rather than repeat the process from scratch. Here are some links to information on this topic:

[Removing Windows 10 in-box apps during a task sequence](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mniehaus/2015/11/11/removing-windows-10-in-box-apps-during-a-task-sequence/)

[Removing Built-in apps from Windows 10 WIM-File with Powershell - Version 1.3](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Removing-Built-in-apps-65dc387b)

[Windows 10 1607: Keeping apps from coming back when deploying the feature update](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mniehaus/2016/08/23/windows-10-1607-keeping-apps-from-coming-back-when-deploying-the-feature-update/)

Then run the [Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/dism/remove-appxprovisionedpackage?view=win10-ps) PowerShell command to remove UWP app payloads:

```powershell
Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online -PackageName 
```

Each UWP app should be evaluated for applicability in each unique environment. You will want to install a default installation of Windows 10, version 1803, then note which apps are running and consuming memory. For example, you might want to consider removing apps that start automatically, or apps that automatically display information on the Start menu, such as Weather and News, and that might not be of use in your environment.

One of the "inbox" UWP apps called Photos, has a default setting called **Show a notification when new albums are available**.  The Photos app can use approximately 145 MB of memory; specifically private working set memory, even if not being used.  Changing the **Show a notification when new albums are available** setting for all users is not practical at this time, hence the recommendation to remove the Photos app if it is not needed or desired.

### Clean up optional features

#### Managing optional features with PowerShell

 To enumerate currently installed Windows Features, run this PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online
```

You can enable or disable a specific Windows optional feature as in this example:

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "DirectPlay" -All
```

For more about this, see [Windows 10: Managing optional features with PowerShell](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/39386.windows-10-managing-optional-features-with-powershell.aspx).

#### Enable or disable Windows features by using DISM

You can use the built-in **Dism.exe** tool to enumerate and control Windows optional features. You can set up a Dism.exe script to run during a task sequence that installs the operating system.

### Local policy settings

Many optimizations for Windows 10 in a VDI environment can be made using Windows policy. The settings listed here can be applied locally to the base image. Then if the equivalent settings are not specified in any other way such as by group policy, the settings would still apply.

Some decisions might be based on the specifics of the environment, for example:

-   Is the VDI environment allowed to access the Internet?

-   Is the VDI solution persistent or non-persistent?

The following settings specifically do not counter or conflict with any setting that has anything to do with security. These settings were chosen to remove settings that might not be applicable to VDI environments.

If you enable this policy setting, NCSI does not run either of the two active tests. This might reduce the ability of NCSI, and of other components that use NCSI, to determine Internet access) NOTE: There are other policies that allow you to redirect NCSI tests to internal resources, if this functionality is desired. |

### Notes about Network Connectivity Status indicator

The group policy settings above include settings to turn off checking to see if
the system is connected to the Internet. If your environment does not connect to
the Internet at all, or connects indirectly, you can set a group policy setting
to remove the Network icon from the Taskbar. The reason you might want to remove
the Network icon from the Taskbar is if you turn off Internet connectivity
checks, there will be a yellow flag on the Network icon, even though the network
might be functioning normally. If you would like to remove the network icon as a
group policy setting, you can find that in this location:

| Windows Update or Windows Update for Business                | Select when Quality Updates are received | 1. 30 days 2. Pause quality updates starting yyyy-mm-dd | Enabled                             |

| **Start Menu and Taskbar**                  | Remove the networking icon               |                         | **Enabled** (the networking icon is not displayed in the system notification area.) |

### System services

If you are considering disabling system services to conserve resources, take great care that the service being considered is not in some way a component
of some other service.

Also, most of these recommendations mirror recommendations for Windows Server
2016 with Desktop Experience; for more information, see [Guidance on disabling system services in Windows Server 2016 with Desktop Experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/security/windows-services/security-guidelines-for-disabling-system-services-in-windows-server).

Note that a lot of services that might seem to be good candidates to disable are set to manual service start type. This means that the service will not automatically start and is not started unless a specific application or service triggers a request to the service being consider for disabling. Services that are already set to start type manual are usually not listed here.

#### Per-user services in Windows

[Per-user services](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/application-management/per-user-services-in-windows) are services that are created when a user signs into Windows or Windows Server and are stopped and deleted when that user signs out. These services run in the security context of the user account - this provides better resource management than the previous approach of running these kinds of services in Explorer, associated with a preconfigured account, or as tasks. 

### Scheduled tasks

Like other items in Windows, ensure that an item is not needed before you consider disabling it.

The following list of tasks are those that perform optimizations or data collections on computers that maintain their state across reboots. When a VDI VM task reboots and discards all changes since last boot, optimizations intended for physical computers are not helpful.

You can get all of the current scheduled tasks, including descriptions, with the following PowerShell code:

`Get-ScheduledTask | Select-Object -Property TaskPath,TaskName,State,Description |Export-CSV -Path C:\Temp\W10_1803_SchTasks.csv -NoTypeInformation`

Valid **Scheduled Task Name** values include:

- OneDrive Standalone Update Task v2
- Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser
- ProgramDataUpdater
- StartupAppTask
- CleanupTemporaryState
- Proxy
- UninstallDeviceTask
- ProactiveScan

### Apply Windows and other updates

Whether from Microsoft Update, or from your internal resources, apply available updates including Windows Defender signatures. This is a good time to apply other available updates including those for Microsoft Office if installed.

### Automatic Windows traces

Windows is configured, by default, to collect and save limited diagnostic data. The purpose is to enable diagnostics, or to record data in the event that further troubleshooting is necessary. You can find automatic system traces by starting the Computer Management app, and then expanding **System Tools**, **Performance**, **Data Collector Sets**, and then selecting **Event Trace Sessions**.


Some of the traces displayed under **Event Trace Sessions** and **Startup Event Trace Sessions** cannot and should not be stopped. Others, such as the **WiFiSession** trace can be stopped. To stop a running trace under **Event Trace Sessions** right-click the trace and then select **Stop**. To prevent the traces from starting automatically on startup, follow these steps:

1.  Select the **Startup Event Trace Sessions** folder

2.  Locate the trace of interest, and then double-click that trace.

3.  Select the **Trace Session** tab.

4.  Clear the box labeled **Enabled**. 

5.  Select **OK**.

Here are some system traces to consider disabling for VDI use:

| Name                    | Comment                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| AppModel                | A collection of traces, one of which is phone |
| CloudExperienceHostOOBE |               |
| DiagLog                 |               |
| NtfsLog                 |               |
| TileStore               |               |
| UBPM                    |               |
| WiFiDriverIHVSession    | If not using a WiFi device                    |
| WiFiSession             |               |

#### Servicing the operating system and apps

At some point during the image optimization process available Windows updates should be applied. You can set Windows Update to install updates for other Microsoft products as well as Windows. To set this, open **Windows Settings**, then select **Update & Security**, and then select **Advanced options**. Select **Give me updates for other Microsoft products when I update Windows** to set it to **On**.

This would be a good setting in case you are going to install Microsoft applications such as Microsoft Office to the base image. That way Office is up to date when the image is put in service. There are also .NET updates and certain non-Microsoft components such as Adobe that have updates available through Windows Update.

One very important consideration for non-persistent VDI VMs are security updates, including security software definition files. These updates might be released once or even more than once per day. There might be a way to retain these updates, including Windows Defender and non-Microsoft components.

For Windows Defender it might be best to allow the updates to occur, even on non-persistent VDI. The updates are going to apply nearly every logon session, but the updates are small and should not be a problem. Plus, the VM won't be behind on updates because only the latest available will apply. The same might be true for non-Microsoft definition files.

> [!NOTE]  
> Store apps (UWP apps) update through the Windows Store. Modern versions of Office such as Office 365 update through their own mechanisms when directly connected to the Internet, or via management technologies when not.

### Windows Defender optimization with VDI

Microsoft has recently published documentation regarding Windows Defender in a VDI environment. See [Deployment guide for Windows Defender Antivirus in a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/deployment-vdi-windows-defender-antivirus) for details.

The above article contains procedures to service the gold VDI image, and how to maintain the VDI clients as they are running. To reduce network bandwidth when VDI computers need to update their Windows Defender signatures, stagger reboots, and schedule reboots during off hours where possible. The Windows Defender signature updates can be contained internally on file shares, and where
practical, have those files shares on the same or close networking segments as the VDI virtual machines.

See the paper listed at the beginning of this section for much more information about optimizing Windows Defender with VDI.

### Tuning Windows 10 network performance by using registry settings

This is especially important in environments where the VDI or physical computer has a workload that is primarily network based. The settings in this section bias performance to favor networking, by setting up additional buffering and caching of things like directory entries and so on.

Note that some settings in this section are *registry-based only* and should be incorporated in the base image before the image is deployed for production use.

The following settings are documented in the [Windows Server 2016 Performance Tuning Guideline](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/performance-tuning/)
information, published on Microsoft.com by the Windows Product Group.

#### DisableBandwidthThrottling

HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanWorkstation\\Parameters\\DisableBandwidthThrottling

Applies to Windows 10. The default is **0**. By default, the SMB redirector throttles throughput across high-latency network connections, in some cases to avoid network-related timeouts. Setting this registry value to **1** disables this throttling, enabling higher file transfer throughput over high-latency network connections, so you should consider this setting.

#### FileInfoCacheEntriesMax

HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanWorkstation\\Parameters\\FileInfoCacheEntriesMax

Applies to Windows 10. The default is **64**, with a valid range of 1 to 65536. This value is used to determine the amount of file metadata that can be cached by the client. Increasing the value can reduce network traffic and increase performance when many files are accessed. Try increasing this value to **1024**.

#### DirectoryCacheEntriesMax

HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanWorkstation\\Parameters\\DirectoryCacheEntriesMax

Applies to Windows 10. The default is **16**, with a valid range of 1 to 4096. This value is used to determine the amount of directory information that can be cached by the client. Increasing the value can reduce network traffic and increase performance when large directories are accessed. Consider increasing this value to **1024**.

#### FileNotFoundCacheEntriesMax

HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanWorkstation\\Parameters\\FileNotFoundCacheEntriesMax

Applies to Windows 10. The default is **128**, with a valid range of 1 to 65536. This value is used to determine the amount of file name information that can be cached by the client. Increasing the value can reduce network traffic and increase performance when many file names are accessed. Consider increasing this value to **2048**.

#### DormantFileLimit

HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanWorkstation\\Parameters\\DormantFileLimit

Applies to Windows 10. The default is **1023**. This parameter specifies the maximum number of files that should be left open on a shared resource after the application has closed the file. Where many thousands of clients are connecting to SMB servers, consider reducing this value to **256**.

You can configure many of these SMB settings by using the [Set-SmbClientConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/smbshare/set-smbclientconfiguration)
and [Set-SmbServerConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/smbshare/set-smbserverconfiguration)
Windows PowerShell cmdlets. You can configure registry-only settings by using Windows PowerShell as well, as in the following example:

`Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanWorkstation\\Parameters" RequireSecuritySignature -Value 0 -Force`

### Additional settings from the Windows Restricted Traffic Limited Functionality Baseline guidance

Microsoft has released a baseline  created using the same procedures as the [Windows Security Baselines](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/device-security/windows-security-baselines), for environments that are either not connected directly to the Internet, or want to reduce data sent to Microsoft and other services.

The [Windows Restricted Traffic Limited Functionality Baseline](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/privacy/manage-connections-from-windows-operating-system-components-to-microsoft-services)
settings are marked in the Group Policy table with an asterisk.

### Disk cleanup (including using the Disk Cleanup wizard)

Disk cleanup can be especially helpful with master image VDI implementations. After the master image is prepared, updated, and configured, one of the last tasks to perform is disk cleanup. The Disk Cleanup wizard built into Windows can help clean up most potential areas of disk space savings.

> [!NOTE]  
> The Disk Cleanup wizard is no longer being developed. Windows will use other methods to provide disk cleanup functions.



Here are suggestions for various disk cleanup tasks. You should test these before implementing any of them:

1. Run the Disk Cleanup wizard (elevated) after applying all updates. Include the categories **Delivery Optimization** and **Windows Update Cleanup**. You can automate this process with **Cleanmgr.exe** with the **/SAGESET:11** option. This option sets registry values that can be used later to automate disk cleanup, using every available option in the Disk Cleanup wizard.

   1.  On a test VM, from a clean installation, running **Cleanmgr.exe /SAGESET:11** reveals that there are only two automatic disk cleanup options enabled by default:

   - Downloaded Program Files

   - Temporary Internet Files

   2. If you set more options, or all options, those options are recorded in the registry, according to the index value provided in the previous command (**Cleanmgr.exe /SAGESET:11**). In this example, we use the value *11* as our index, for a subsequent automated disk cleanup procedure.

   3. After running **Cleanmgr.exe /SAGESET:11** you will see a number of categories of disk cleanup options. You can select every option, and then select **OK**. You will notice that the Disk Cleanup wizard just disappears. However, the settings you selected are saved in the registry, and can be invoked by running **Cleanmgr.exe /SAGERUN:11**.

2. Clean up Volume Shadow Copy storage, if any is in use. To do this, run the following commands in an elevated prompt:

   - **vssadmin list shadows**

   - **vssadmin list shadowstorage**

       If the output from these commands is *No items found that satisfy the query.*, then there is no VSS storage in use.

3. Cleanup temporary files and logs. From an elevated command prompt, run these commands:

   - **Del C:\\\*.tmp /s**

   - **Del C:\\Windows\\Temp\\.**

   - **Del %temp%\\.**

4. Delete any unused profiles on the system with this command:

   **wmic path win32_UserProfile where LocalPath="c:\\\\users\\\\\<user\>" Delete**

### Remove OneDrive

Removing OneDrive involves removing the package, uninstalling, and removing \*.lnk files. You can use following sample PowerShell code to assist in removing OneDrive from the image:

```azurecli

Taskkill.exe /F /IM "OneDrive.exe"
Taskkill.exe /F /IM "Explorer.exe"` 
    if (Test-Path "C:\\Windows\\System32\\OneDriveSetup.exe")`
     { Start-Process "C:\\Windows\\System32\\OneDriveSetup.exe"`
         -ArgumentList "/uninstall"`
         -Wait }
    if (Test-Path "C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\OneDriveSetup.exe")`
     { Start-Process "C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\OneDriveSetup.exe"`
         -ArgumentList "/uninstall"`
         -Wait }
Remove-Item -Path
"C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\LocalService\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\OneDrive.lnk" -Force
Remove-Item -Path "C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\NetworkService\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\OneDrive.lnk" -Force \# Remove the automatic start item for OneDrive from the default user profile registry hive
Start-Process C:\\Windows\\System32\\Reg.exe -ArgumentList "Load HKLM\\Temp C:\\Users\\Default\\NTUSER.DAT" -Wait
Start-Process C:\\Windows\\System32\\Reg.exe -ArgumentList "Delete HKLM\\Temp\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v OneDriveSetup /f" -Wait
Start-Process C:\\Windows\\System32\\Reg.exe -ArgumentList "Unload HKLM\\Temp" -Wait Start-Process -FilePath C:\\Windows\\Explorer.exe -Wait
```
