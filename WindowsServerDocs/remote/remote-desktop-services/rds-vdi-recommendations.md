# Recommended settings for VDI desktops

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows 10

Microsoft Desktop Virtualization automatically detects device configurations and network conditions to get users up and running sooner by enabling the instant setup of corporate applications and desktops, and it equips IT to provide access to legacy applications during migration to Windows 10.

Although the Windows 10 operating system is very well tuned out of the box, there are opportunities for you to refine it further specifically for the corporate Microsoft Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environment. In the VDI environment, many background services and tasks are disabled from the beginning.

This topic is not a blueprint, but rather a guide or starting point. Some recommendations might disable functionality that you would prefer to use, so you should consider the cost versus the benefit of adjusting any particular setting in your scenario.

These instructions and recommended settings are relevant to Windows 10 1607 (version 10.0.1393).

> [!NOTE]  
> Any settings not specifically mentioned in this topic can be left at their default values (or set per your requirements and policies) without appreciable impact on VDI functionality.

When you create an image to base the VDI deployment, be sure to use the **Current Branch**. For more information about Current Branch, see [Windows 10 release information](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows/release-info.aspx).

## Creating the Windows 10 image
The first step is to install a reference image of Windows 10 1607 (version 10.0.1393) on either a physical  or virtual machine. Installing to a virtual machine is easy and allows you to save versions of the virtual hard-disk (VHD) file, in case you want to roll back to an earlier version.

During installation, you can choose either **Express Settings** or **Customize**. The settings offered during the **Customize** option are adjustable by using Group Policy, so the method of installing the base OS is not that important.


If you chose **Customize**, you can adjust these settings during installation:

## In "Customize settings"

You can also adjust these after installation with Group Policy Editor; see the "Group Policy settings" section of this topic.

|Setting|Default value|Recommended value for VDI use|  
|-------------------|----------|--------------|
|**Personalization**| | |
|Personalize your speech, typing, and inking input by sending your input data to Microsoft.|	On|	Off|
|Send typing and inking data to Microsoft to improve the recognition and suggestion platform.|	On|	Off|
|Let apps use your advertising ID for experience across apps.|	On|	Off|
|Let Skype (if installed) help you connect with friends in your address book and verify your mobile number. SMS and data charges may apply.|	On|	Off|
|**Location**| | |
|Turn on Find My Device and let Windows and apps request your location, including location history|	On|	Off|
|Connectivity and error reporting| | |
|Automatically connect to suggested open hotspots. Not all networks are secure.|	On|	Off|
|Automatically connect to open hotspots temporarily to see if paid network services are available.|	On|	Off|
|Send full diagnostic and usage data to Microsoft. Turning this off sends only basic data.|	On|	Off|
|**Browser, protection, and update**| | |
|Use SmartScreen online services to help protect against malicious content and downloads in sites loaded by Windows browsers and Store apps|	On|	On (If there is no Internet access, then set to Off.)
|Use page prediction to improve reading, speed up browsing, and make your overall experience better in Windows browsers. Your browsing data will be sent to Microsoft.|	On|	Off|
|Get updates from and send updates to other PCs on the Internet to speed up app and Windows Update downloads|	On|	Off|

Once installation is complete, you can continue adjusting settings starting with **Windows Settings**.

## In Windows Settings
To access Windows Settings, click **Start** (the Windows icon on the taskbar), and then click the **Settings** icon (shaped like a gear).

### In the "System" area of Windows Settings
In Windows Settings area, clicking the **System** icon gives you access to a number of system-related settings. Not all of them need adjustment for optimum VDI use--these settings are the most important:

#### Apps and features

To remove an app, thereby excluding it from your VDI image, click the app, and then click **Uninstall**. If **Uninstall** is grayed out, you cannot remove it by this method; you might be able to remove it with Windows PowerShell, or try these steps:
1. Click **Manage optional features** (immediately below the **Apps and features** heading on the same page).
2. Click the optional feature, and then click **Uninstall**.

Features to consider removing (if present) include the following:
- **Contact support**
- **English (United States) Retail Demo Content**
- **Neutral Retail Demo Content**
- **Quick Assist**

#### Default apps

This area defines the app to be used by default for certain generic functions such as e-mail, web browsing, and maps. If you want a different app to be used for a particular function, click the current entry, and then click the app you prefer to be used in the VDI image. For a non-Microsoft app to be an available choice, you must install the app prior to adjusting this setting.

#### Notifications and actions

These recommended values will reduce notifications and background network activity in a VDI environment:

|Setting|Default value|Recommended value for VDI use|  
|-------------------|----------|--------------|
|Get notifications from apps and other senders|	On|	Off|
|Show notifications on the lock screen.|	On|	Off|
|Show alarms, reminders, and incoming VoIP calls on the lock screen.|	On|	Off|
|Show tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows.|	On|	Off|


#### Offline maps

This setting is only applicable if the Maps app is installed. Its default value is **On**; for VDI use the recommended value is **Off**. 

#### Tablet mode

|Setting|Default value|Recommended value for VDI use|  
|-------------------|----------|--------------|
|When I sign in|	Use the appropriate mode for my hardware|	Use desktop mode|
|When this device automatically switches mode on or off|	Always ask me before switching|	Don't ask me and don't switch|
|Hide app icons on the taskbar in tablet mode|	On|	Off|


### In the "Devices" area of Windows Settings
In Windows Settings area, clicking the **Devices** icon gives you access to a number of system-related settings. Not all of them need adjustment for optimum VDI use--these settings are the most important:

#### Autoplay

|Setting|Default value|Recommended value for VDI use|  
|-------------------|----------|--------------|
|Use Autoplay for all media and devices|	On|	Off|
|Removable drive:|Choose a default|Take no action|
|Memory card|Choose a default|Take no action|

### In the "Personalization" area of Windows Settings
In Windows Settings area, clicking the **Personalization** icon gives you access to a number of system-related settings. Not all of them need adjustment for optimum VDI use--these settings are the most important:

#### Background
Sometimes the default black background can cause users to think the computer is not responding. Changing the background color can help make it clearer. To do this, follow these steps:
1. In the **Background** area, click the pulldown menu.
2. To change the background color, click **Solid color**, and then click any of the colors other than black. Alternately, you could click **Picture** and then select an image to use as the background.

#### Start

|Setting|Default value|Recommended value for VDI use|  
|-------------------|----------|--------------|
|Occasionally show suggestions in Start|	On|	Off|
|Show most used apps|On|Off|
|Show recently added apps|On|Off|
|Show recently opened items in Jump Lists on Start or the Taskbar|On|Off|

#### Taskbar
The default setting is to use large taskbar buttons (that is, a value of "Off" for **Use small taskbar buttons**). This setting causes the Cortana item to use a lot of taskbar area. To avoid this, set **Use small taskbar buttons** to "On." If you prefer that the taskbar items stay larger, but prefer not to have Cortana taking up so much space, right-click the taskbar, point to **Cortana**, and in the menu that flies out, select **Hidden**.

### In the "Privacy" area of Windows Settings
In Windows Settings area, clicking the **Privacy** icon gives you access to a number of system-related settings. Not all of them need adjustment for optimum VDI use--these settings are the most important:

#### General
Some of these settings are also set from the "Customize settings" window, discussed at the beginning of this topic.

|Setting|Default value|Recommended value for VDI use|  
|-------------------|----------|--------------|
|Let apps use my advertising ID for experiences across apps (turning this off will reset your ID)|	On|	Off|
|Let websites provide locally relevant content by accessing my language list|On|Off|

The default value for "Let apps control radios" is **On**; for VDI use the recommended value is **Off**.

#### Other devices

The default value for "Let your apps automatically share and sync info with wireless devices that don't explicitly pair with your PC, tablet, or phone" is **On**; for VDI use the recommended value is **Off**.

#### Feedback and diagnostics

The default value for "Windows should ask for my feedback" is **Automatically**; for VDI use, the recommended value is **Never**.

#### Background apps
Listed apps have a default value of **On**, which allows them to receive information, send notifications, and update themselves whether they are being used or not. You should disable (set to **Off**) any apps you don't want running in the background in the VDI image.

### Update and security
#### Windows Update
In the **Update settings** area, click **Advanced options** to adjust these settings:

|Setting|Default value|Recommended value for VDI use|

## Microsoft Store apps
There are a number of Microsoft Store apps that you might want to remove from the VDI image; removing them will decrease CPU usage and conserve disk space. Good candidates for removal include:

- Get Office
- Skype (preview)
- Get Started (especially if there is no Internet connection)
- Feedback Hub
- Microsoft Solitaire Collection
- Paid Wi-Fi and Cellular

To customize the default user profile used for creating VDI images, use the built-in Administrator account. If it is not already enabled, do so by using Local Users and Groups in Computer Management. Then log in to the Administrator account to complete the following steps.

> [!NOTE]  
> Don't remove system apps such as the Store app. They are difficult to reinstall. Other apps are easily reinstallable from the Store.

### Delete unwanted apps from the Administrator user profile
1. In Windows PowerShell, run `Get-AppxPackage | ft PackageFamilyName` to see the list of installed apps.
2. For each app packager you want to uninstall run cmdlets of this example format:

    `Get-AppxPackage *messaging* | Remove-AppxPackage`

    `Get-AppxPackage *WindowsMaps* | Remove-AppxPackage`

    `Get-AppxPackage *ZuneMusic* | Remove-AppxPackage`

### Delete the payload of unwanted Store apps
This will prevent the apps from being reinstalled.
1. List Store apps and other items that have provisioned data in storage with this cmdlet: `Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online`.
2. Remove a given package with `Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online -PackageName MyAppPackage`, using the appropriate MyAppPackage returned from Step 1. For example, to remove the Zune-related package, you would run `Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online -PackageName Microsoft.ZuneMusic_2019.17012.10311.0_neutral_~_8wekyb3d8bbwe`.

## Removing other items
You can remove the OneDrive icon and app, turn off system icons, and delete downloaded updates.

### Remove OneDrive icon and app
