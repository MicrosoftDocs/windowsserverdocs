# Input method editor issue in RemoteApp scenarios

We've been made aware of the following issues with the input method editor (IME) through user feedback:

- Users have reported being unable to change IME mode from their applications.
- Users couldn't change IME mode using the keyboard.
- Switching between remote applications doesn't change the IME mode.

Affected platforms:

- Windows Virtual Desktop
- Remote Desktop Services (so far, this issue has only been reported for Windows Server 2019)

We're currently working on a solution to help solve this issue.
