# Optimizing Windows configuration for VDI desktops

Although the Windows operating system is well tuned out of the box, there are opportunities for you to refine it further, specifically for the corporate Microsoft Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environment. In the VDI environment, many background services and tasks are disabled by default.

This article is a guide or starting point for how you might optimize your configuration. Some recommendations disable functionality that you prefer to use, so you must consider the cost versus the benefit of adjusting a particular setting in your scenario.

>[!NOTE]
> Any settings not specifically mentioned in this topic can be left at their default values (or set per your requirements and policies) without appreciable impact on VDI functionality.

## VDI optimization principles

A "full" virtual desktop environment can present a complete desktop session, including applications, to a computer user over a network. The network delivery vehicle can be an on-premises network, the Internet, or both. Some implementations of virtual desktop environments use a "base" operating system image, which then becomes the basis for the desktops then presented to the users for work. There are variations of virtual desktop implementations such as **persistent**, **non-persistent**, and **desktop session**.

- The persistent type preserves changes to the virtual desktop operating system from one session to the next.
- The non-persistent type doesn't preserve changes to the virtual desktop operating system from one session to the next.
- The desktop session is like sessions on other virtual or physical devices, and accessed over a network.

The optimization settings could take place on a reference machine. A virtual machine (VM) is an ideal place to build the VM, because state is saved, there are checkpoints, and backups are made. A default OS installation is performed to the base VM. That base VM is then optimized by doing things like removing unneeded apps, installing updates, deleting temporary files, and applying settings.

Security and stability are among the highest priorities for Microsoft when it comes to products and services. In the virtual desktop realm, security isn't handled much differently than physical devices. Enterprise customers may choose to utilize the built-in to Windows services of Windows Security, which comprises a suite of services that work well connected or not connected to the Internet. For those virtual desktop environments not connected to the Internet, security signatures can be downloaded proactively several times per day, because Microsoft may release more than one signature update per day. Those signatures can then be provided to the virtual desktop devices and scheduled to be installed during production, regardless of persistent or non-persistent. That way the VM protection is as current as possible.

There are some security settings not applicable to virtual desktop environments not connected to the internet and unable to participate in cloud-enabled security. There are other settings that "normal" Windows devices may utilize such as Cloud Experience, or The Windows Store. Removing access to unused features reduces footprint, network bandwidth, and attack surface.

Windows utilizes a monthly update rhythm. In some cases, virtual desktop administrators control the update process by shutting down VMs based on a "master" or "gold" image, unsealing that read-only image, patching the image, then resealing it and bringing it back into production. Therefore, there's no need to have virtual desktop devices checking Windows Update. However, there are cases where normal patching procedures take place, like the case of persistent "personal" virtual desktop devices. In some cases, Windows Update can be utilized. In some cases, Intune could be utilized. In some cases, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (formerly SCCM) is utilized to handle update and other package delivery. It's up to each organization to determine the best approach to updating virtual desktop devices, while reducing overhead cycles.

The local policy settings, and many other settings in this guide, can be overridden with domain-based policy. We recommended that you go through the policy settings thoroughly and remove or not use any that aren't desired or applicable to your environment. The settings listed in this document try to achieve the best balance of performance optimization in virtual desktop environments, while maintaining a quality user experience.

>[!NOTE]
> There's a set of [scripts available on GitHub](https://github.com/The-Virtual-Desktop-Team/Virtual-Desktop-Optimization-Tool) that'll do all the work items documented in this paper. The scripts are designed to be easily customizable for your environment and requirements. The main code is PowerShell, and the work is done by calling input files, which are plain text (now .JSON), with also Local Group Policy Object (LGPO) tool export files. These text files contain lists of the apps to be removed, services to be disabled, and so on. If you don't want to remove a particular app or disable a particular service, you can edit the corresponding text file and remove the item you don't want acted upon. Finally, there's an export of local policy settings that can be imported into your environment machines. It's better to have some of the settings within the base image, than to have the settings applied through group policy, as some of the settings take effect on the next restart or when a component is first used.

## Non-persistent virtual desktop environments

When a non-persistent virtual desktop implementation is based on a base or "gold" image, the optimizations are mostly performed in the base image, and then through local settings and local policies.

With image-based non-persistent (NP) virtual desktop environments, the base image is read-only. When an NP virtual desktop device (VM) is started, a copy of the base image is streamed to the VM. Activity that occurs during startup and thereafter until the next reboot is redirected to a temporary location. Users are provided network locations to store their data. In some cases, the user’s profile is merged with the standard VM to provide the user with their settings.

One important aspect of NP virtual desktop that is based on a single image, is servicing. Updates to the operating system (OS) and components of the OS are delivered once per month. With image based virtual desktop environment, there's a set of processes that must be performed to get updates to the image:

- On a given host, all the VMs on that host, based on the base image must be shut down or turned off. This means the users are redirected to other VMs.
- In some implementations, this is referred to as "draining." The virtual machine or session host, when set to draining mode, stops accepting new requests, but continues servicing users currently connected to the device.
- In draining mode, when the last user logs off the device, that device is then ready for servicing operations.
- The base image is then opened and started up. All maintenance activities are then performed, such as OS updates, .NET updates, app updates, and so on.
- Any new settings that need to be applied are applied at this time.
- Any other maintenance is performed at this time.
- The base image is then shut down.
- The base image is sealed and set to go back into production.
- Users are allowed to log back on.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows performs a set of maintenance tasks, automatically, on a periodic basis. There's a scheduled task that is set to run at 3:00 AM every day by default. This scheduled task performs a list of tasks, including Windows Update cleanup. You can view all the categories of maintenance that take place automatically with this PowerShell command:
>
> ```powershell
> Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object {$_.Settings.MaintenanceSettings}
> ```

One of the challenges with non-persistent virtual desktop is that when a user logs off, nearly all the OS activity is discarded. The user’s profile and/or state may be saved to a centralized location, but the virtual machine itself discards nearly all changes that were made since last boot. Therefore, optimizations intended for a Windows computer that saves state from one session to the next aren't applicable.

Depending on the architecture of virtual desktop device, things like PreFetch and SuperFetch aren't going to help from one session to the next, as all the optimizations are discarded on VM restart. Indexing may be a partial waste of resources, as would be any disk optimizations such as a traditional defragmentation.

> [!NOTE]
> If preparing an image using virtualization, and if connected to the Internet during image creation process, on first logon you should postpone Feature Updates by going to **Settings** > **Windows Update**.

## To sysprep or not sysprep

Windows has a built-in capability called the [System Preparation Tool](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep--system-preparation--overview), also known as sysprep. The sysprep tool is used to prepare a customized Windows 10 or Windows 11 image for duplication. The sysprep process assures the resulting OS is properly unique to run in production.

There are reasons for and against running sysprep. For virtual desktop environments, you may want the ability to customize the default user profile, which would be used as the profile template for later users that sign in using this image. You may have apps that you want installed, but also want to be able to control per-app settings.

The alternative is to use a standard .ISO to install from, possibly using an unattended installation answer file, and a task sequence to install applications or remove applications. You can also use a task sequence to set local policy settings in the image, perhaps using the [Local Group Policy Object Utility (LGPO)](/windows/security/operating-system-security/device-management/windows-security-configuration-framework/security-compliance-toolkit-10#what-is-the-local-group-policy-object-lgpo-tool) tool.

## Supportability

Anytime that Windows defaults are changed, questions arise regarding supportability. Once a virtual desktop image (VM or session) is customized, every change made to the image needs to be tracked in a change log. If a time comes to troubleshoot, often an image can be isolated in a pool and configured for problem analysis. Once a problem is tracked to the root cause, that change can then be rolled out to the test environment first, and ultimately to the production workload.

This document intentionally avoids touching system services, policies, or tasks that affect security. After that comes Windows servicing. The ability to service virtual desktop images outside of maintenance windows is removed, as maintenance windows are when most servicing events take place in virtual desktop environments, except for security software updates. Microsoft's guidance for Windows Security in virtual desktop environments is documented in the [Deployment guide for Windows Defender Antivirus in a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/deployment-vdi-windows-defender-antivirus)

Consider supportability when altering default Windows settings. Occasionally, difficult to solve problems arise when altering system services, policies, or scheduled tasks, in the name of hardening, "lightening," and so on. Consult the Microsoft Knowledge Base for current known issues regarding altered default settings. The guidance in this document, and the associated script on GitHub are maintained with respect to known issues, if any arise. In addition, you can report issues in many ways to Microsoft.

You can use your favorite search engine with the terms `"start value" site:support.microsoft.com` to bring up known issues regarding default start values for services.

This document and the associated scripts on GitHub don't modify any default permissions. If you're interested in increasing your security settings, start with the project known as AaronLocker. For more information, ["AaronLocker" overview](https://github.com/microsoft/AaronLocker).

## Virtual desktop optimization categories

The following categories are ways in which the virtual desktop can be optimized:

- Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app cleanup
- Optional features cleanup
- Local policy settings
- System services
- Scheduled tasks
- Apply Windows (and other) updates
- Automatic Windows traces
- Windows Defender optimization with VDI
- Client network performance tuning by registry settings
- Other settings from the "Windows Restricted Traffic Limited Functionality Baseline" guidance.
- Disk cleanup

The following sections explain each category in more detail.

### Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application cleanup

One of the goals of a virtual desktop image is to be as light as possible with respect to persistent storage. One way to reduce the size of the image is to remove unused UWP applications (apps). With UWP apps, there are the main application files, also known as the payload. There's a small amount of data stored in each user’s profile for application-specific settings. There's also a small amount of data in the "All Users" profile.

In addition, all UWP apps are registered at either the user or machine level at some point after startup for the device, and login for the user. The UWP apps, which include the Start Menu and the Windows Shell, perform various tasks at or after installation, and again when a user logs in for the first time, and to a lesser extent at subsequent logins. For all UWP apps, there are occasional evaluations that take place, such as:

- Do you need to update the app to the latest version?
- The app, if pinned to the Start Menu, might have live tile data to download
- Does the app have a cache of data that needs to be updated, such as maps or weather?
- Does the app have persistent data from the user's profile that needs to be presented at login (for example, Sticky Notes)

With a default installation of Windows, it's unlikely that all UWP apps are used by an organization. Therefore, if those apps are removed, there are fewer evaluations that need to take place, less caching, and so on. The second method here's to direct Windows to disable "consumer experiences." This reduces Store activity by having to check for every user what apps are installed, what apps are available, and then to start downloading some UWP apps. The performance savings can be significant when there are hundreds or thousands of users, all start work at approximately the same time, or even starting work at rolling times across time zones.

Connectivity and timing are important factors when it comes to UWP app cleanup. If you deploy your base image to a device with no network connectivity, Windows can't connect to the Microsoft Store and download apps and try to install them while you're trying to uninstall them. This might be a good strategy to allow you time to customize your image, and then update what remains at a later stage of the image creation process.

If you modify your base .WIM that you use to install Windows and remove unneeded UWP apps from the .WIM before you install, the apps don't install and your subsequent profile creation times are shorter. There's a link later in this section with information on how to remove UWP apps from your installation .WIM file.

A good strategy for the virtual desktop environment is to provision the apps you want in the base image, then limit or block access to the Microsoft Store afterward. Store apps are updated periodically in the background on normal computers. The UWP apps can be updated during the maintenance window when other updates are applied.

#### Delete the payload of UWP apps

UWP apps that aren't needed are still in the file system consuming a small amount of disk space. For apps that aren't needed, the payload of unwanted UWP apps can be removed from the base image using PowerShell commands. If you delete UWP app payloads out of the installation .WIM file using the links provided later in this section, you can start from the beginning with a slim list of UWP apps.

Run the following PowerShell command to enumerate provisioned UWP apps currently running on the local computer:

```powershell
Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online
```

UWP apps that are provisioned to a system can be removed during OS installation as part of a task sequence, or later after the OS is installed. This may be the preferred method because it makes the overall process of creating or maintaining an image modular. Once you develop the scripts, if something changes in a subsequent build you edit an existing script rather than repeat the process from scratch.

Then run the following PowerShell command to remove UWP app payloads:

```powershell
Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online - PackageName MyAppxPackage
```

As a final note on this topic, each UWP app should be evaluated for applicability in each unique environment. Install a default installation of Windows 10 or Windows 11, and then note which apps are running and consuming memory. For example, you might remove apps that start automatically, or apps that automatically display information on the Start Menu, such as Weather and News.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using the scripts from GitHub, you can easily control which apps are removed before running the script. After downloading the script files, locate the AppxPackage.json file, edit that file, and remove entries for apps that you want to keep, such as Calculator, Sticky Notes, and so on.

### Optional features cleanup

This section describes optional features that can be optimized.

#### Managing optional features with PowerShell

You can manage Windows Optional Features using PowerShell. To enumerate currently installed Windows Features, run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online
```

Using PowerShell, an enumerated Windows Optional Feature can be configured as enabled or disabled, as in the following example:

```powershell
Enabled-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "DirectPlay" -All
```

Here's an example command that disables the Windows Media Player feature in the virtual desktop image:

```powershell
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "WindowsMediaPlayer"
```

Next, you may want to remove the Windows Media Player package. This example command shows you how to find the package name:

```powershell
Get-WindowsPackage -Online -PackageName *media*
```

The output of that command shows something like the following information:

```code
PackageName              : Microsoft-Windows-MediaPlayer-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.19041.153
Applicable               : True
Copyright                : Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All Rights Reserved
...
```

If you want to remove the Windows Media Player package (to free up about 60 MB disk space), you can run this command:

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32> Remove-WindowsPackage -PackageName Microsoft-Windows-MediaPlayer-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.19041.153 -Online
```

#### Enable or disabling Windows features using DISM

You can use the built-in `Dism.exe` tool to enumerate and control Windows Optional Features. A Dism.exe script could be developed and run during an operating system installation task sequence with [Features on Demand](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/features-on-demand-v2--capabilities).

#### Default user settings

You can customize the Windows registry file at `C:\Users\Default\NTUSER.DAT`. Any setting changes you make to this file are applied to any subsequent user profiles created from a machine running this image. You can control which settings you wish to apply to the default user profile by editing the **DefaultUserSettings.txt** file.

To reduce transmission of graphical data over the virtual desktop infrastructure, you can set the default background to a solid color instead of the default Windows image. You can also set the sign-in screen to be a solid color, and turn off the opaque blurring effect on sign-in.

The following settings are applied to the default user profile registry hive, mainly to reduce animations. If some or all of these settings aren't desired, delete out the settings that you don't wish to apply to new user profiles based on this image. The goal with these settings is to enable the following equivalent settings:

- Show shadows under mouse pointer
- Show shadows under windows
- Smooth edges of screen fonts

[ ![A screenshot of the performance options menu with the relevant items selected.](media/remote-desktop-services-vdi-optimize-configuration/performance-options.png) ](media/remote-desktop-services-vdi-optimize-configuration/performance-options.png#lightbox)

And there's a method to disable the following two privacy settings for any user profile created after you run the optimization:

- Let websites provide locally relevant content by accessing my language list
- Show me suggested content in the Settings app

Optionally, disable the following two privacy settings for any user profile created after you run the optimization:

- Let websites provide locally relevant content by accessing my language list
- Show me suggested content in the Settings app

[ ![A screenshot of the privacy settings window. The two disabled settings are highlighted in red.](media/remote-desktop-services-vdi-optimize-configuration/privacy-settings.png) ](media/remote-desktop-services-vdi-optimize-configuration/privacy-settings.png#lightbox)

The following are the optimization settings applied to the default user profile registry hive to optimize performance. This operation is performed by first loading the default user profile registry hive **NTUser.dat**, as the ephemeral key name **Temp**, and then making the following modifications:

```regedit
Load HKLM\Temp C:\Users\Default\NTUSER.DAT

```

Disable settings for Windows apps from starting and running in the background. While not significant on a single device, Windows starts multiple processes for each user session on a given device, or session host. If this functionality is desired as-is, delete the lines in the `DefaultUserSettings.txt` file that include the app names like **Windows.Photos** and/or **MicrosoftEdge**.

### Local policy settings

Many optimizations for Windows in a virtual desktop environment can be made using Windows policy. The settings listed in the table in this section can be applied locally to the base/gold image. If the equivalent settings aren't specified in any other way, such as group policy, the settings still apply.

Some decisions may be based on the specifics of the environment.

- Is the virtual desktop environment allowed to access the Internet?
- Is the virtual desktop solution persistent or non-persistent?

The following settings were chosen to not counter or conflict with any setting that has anything to do with security. These settings were chosen to remove settings or disable functionality that may not be applicable to virtual desktop environments.

| Policy setting | Item | Sub-item | Possible setting and comments |
|--------------|----|--------|----------------------------|
| Local Computer Policy \\ Computer Configuration \\ Windows Settings \\ Security Settings | N/A | N/A | N/A |

|Hotspot Authentication|Enable hotspot Authentication| N/A |**Disabled** (This policy setting defines whether WLAN hotspots are probed for Wireless Internet Service Provider roaming (WISPr) protocol support. With this policy setting disabled, WLAN hotspots aren't probed for WISPr protocol support, and users can only authenticate with WLAN hotspots using a web browser.)|
|Microsoft Peer-to-Peer Networking Services|Turn off Microsoft Peer-to-Peer Networking Services|N/A|**Enabled** (This setting turns off Microsoft Peer-to-Peer Networking Services in its entirety and causes all dependent applications to stop working. If you enable this setting, peer-to-peer protocols are turned off.)|
|Network Connectivity Status Indicator<p>(There are other settings in this section that can be used in isolated networks)|Specify passive polling|Disable passive poling (**checkbox**)|**Enabled** (This Policy setting enables you to specify passive polling behavior. NCSI polls various measurements throughout the network stack on a frequent interval to determine if network connectivity is lost. Use the options to control the passive polling behavior.)<P>Disabling NCIS passive polling can improve CPU workload on servers or other machines whose network connectivity is static.<P>This setting may negatively affect Exchange connectivity in Outlook.|
|Offline Files|Allow or Disallow use of the Offline Files feature|N/A|**Disabled** (This policy setting determines whether the Offline Files feature is enabled. Offline Files saves a copy of network files on the user's computer for use when the computer isn't connected to the network. With this policy setting disabled, Offline Files feature is disabled and users can't enable it.)|
|*TCPIP Settings\ IPv6 Transition Technologies| Set Teredo State|Disabled State|**Enabled** (With this setting enabled, and set to "Disabled State", no Teredo interfaces are present on the host)|
*WLAN Service\ WLAN Settings|Allow Windows to automatically connect to suggested open hot spots, to networks shared by contacts, and to hot spots offering paid services|N/A|**Disabled** (This policy setting determines whether users can enable the following WLAN settings: "Connect to suggested open hotspots," "Connect to networks shared by my contacts," and "Enable paid services." With this policy setting disabled, "Connect to suggested open hotspots," "Connect to networks shared by my contacts," and "Enable paid services" are turned off and users on this device are prevented from enabling them.)|

### System services

If you're considering disabling system services to conserve resources, make sure the service isn't a component of some other service. In this paper and with the available GitHub scripts, some services aren't in the list because they can't be disabled in a supported manner.

Most of these recommendations mirror recommendations for Windows Server 2016, installed with the Desktop Experience, based on the instructions in [Guidance on disabling system services on Windows Server 2016 with Desktop Experience](../../security/windows-services/security-guidelines-for-disabling-system-services-in-windows-server.md).

Many services that may seem like good candidates to disable are set to manual service start type. This means that the service doesn't automatically start and start only if an event triggers a request to the service. Services that are already set to start type manual aren't listed here.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enumerate running services with this PowerShell sample code, outputting only the service short name:
>
> ```powershell
> Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq 'Running'} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
> ```

The following table contains some services that may be considered to disable in virtual desktop environments:

#### Per-user services in Windows

Per-user services are services created when a user signs into Windows or Windows Server and stopped and deleted when that user signs out. These services run in the security context of the user account - this provides better resource management than the previous approach of running these kinds of services in Explorer, associated with a preconfigured account, or as tasks. For more information, see [Per-user services in Windows](/windows/application-management/per-user-services-in-windows).

### Scheduled tasks

Like other items in Windows, ensure an item isn't needed before disabling a scheduled task. Some tasks in virtual desktop environments, such as **StartComponentCleanup**, may not be desirable to run in production, but may be good to run during a maintenance window on the "gold image" (reference image).

The following list of tasks includes tasks that perform optimizations or data collections on computers that maintain their state across reboots. When a virtual desktop device reboots and discards all changes since last boot, optimizations intended for physical computers aren't helpful.

You can get all the current scheduled tasks, including descriptions, with the following PowerShell code:

```powershell
  Get-ScheduledTask | Select-Object -Property TaskPath,TaskName,State,Description
```

> [!NOTE]
> There are several tasks that can't be disabled with a script, even when run on an elevated command prompt. The recommendations here, and in the GitHub scripts don't attempt to disable tasks that can't be disabled with a script.

### Apply Windows (and other) updates

Whether from Microsoft Update, or from your internal resources, apply available updates including Windows Defender signatures. This is a good time to apply other available updates including Microsoft Office if installed, and other software updates. If PowerShell remains in the image you can download the latest available help for PowerShell by running the command `Update-Help`.

#### Servicing OS and apps

At some point during the image optimization process, available Windows updates should be applied. There's a setting in Windows update settings that can provide more updates. You can find it at **Settings** > **Advanced options**. Once there, set **Give me updates for other uMirosoft products when I update Windows** to **On**.

This would be a good setting in case you're going to install Microsoft applications such as Microsoft Office to the base image. That way Office is up to date when the image is put in service. There are also .NET updates and certain third-party components such as Adobe that have updates available through Windows Update.

One important consideration for non-persistent virtual desktop devices is security updates, including security software definition files. These updates may be released once or more times per day.

For Windows Defender it may be best to allow the updates to occur, even on non-persistent virtual desktop environments. The updates are going to apply nearly every time you sign in, but the updates are small and shouldn't be a problem. Plus, the device won’t be behind on updates because only the latest available applies. The same may be true for third-party definition files.

>[!NOTE]
> Store apps (UWP apps) update through the Windows Store. Modern versions of Office such as Office 365 update through their own mechanisms when directly connected to the Internet, or through management technologies when not.

#### Windows system startup event traces (AutoLoggers)

Windows is configured by default to collect and save diagnostic data. The purpose is to enable diagnostics, or to record data if further troubleshooting is necessary. Automatic system traces can be found opening **Computer Management** and navigating to **System Tools** > **Performance** > **Data Collector Sets**.

Some of the traces displayed under **Event Trace Sessions** and **Startup Event Trace Sessions** can't and shouldn't be stopped. Others, such as the WiFiSession trace can be stopped. To stop a running trace under **Event Trace Sessions**, right-click the trace and then select **Stop**. Use the following procedure to prevent the traces from starting automatically on startup:

1. Select the **Startup Event Trace Sessions** folder.

1. Find and select the trace file you want to look at to open it.

1. Select the **Trace Session** tab.

1. Uncheck the box labeled **Enabled**.

1. Select **Ok**.

The following table lists some system traces that you should consider disabling in your virtual desktop environments:

|Name|Comment|
|---|--------|
|Cellcore|[Cellular Architecture documentation](/windows-hardware/drivers/network/cellular-architecture-and-driver-model)|
|CloudExperienceHostOOBE|[Plan a Windows Hello for Business deployment](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-how-it-works-technology#cloud-experience-host).|

### Windows Defender optimization in the virtual desktop environment

For more details about how to optimize Windows Defender in a virtual desktop environment, check out the [Deployment guide for Windows Defender Antivirus in a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/deployment-vdi-windows-defender-antivirus).

The deployment guide contains procedures to service the "gold" virtual desktop image, and how to maintain the virtual desktop clients as they're running. To reduce network bandwidth when virtual desktop devices need to update their Windows Defender signatures, stagger reboots, and schedule reboots during off hours where possible. The Windows Defender signature updates can be contained internally on file shares, and where practical, have those files shares on the same or close networking segments as the virtual desktop devices.

### Client network performance tuning by registry settings

There are some registry settings that can increase network performance. This is especially important in environments where the virtual desktop device or physical computer has a workload that is primarily network-based. The settings in this section are recommended to tune performance for the networking workload profile, by setting up extra buffering and caching of things like directory entries and so on.

> [!NOTE]
> Some settings in this section are registry-based only and should be incorporated in the base image before the image is deployed for production use.

The following settings are documented in [Performance tuning guidelines for Windows Server](../../administration/performance-tuning/index.md).

#### DisableBandwidthThrottling

`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\DisableBandwidthThrottling`

Applies to Windows 10 and Windows 11. The default is **0**. By default, the SMB redirector throttles throughput across high-latency network connections, in some cases to avoid network-related timeouts. Setting this registry value to **1** disables this throttling, enabling higher file transfer throughput over high-latency network connections. Consider setting this value to **1**.

#### FileInfoCacheEntriesMax

`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\FileInfoCacheEntriesMax`

Applies to Windows 10 and Windows 11. The default is **64**, with a valid range of 1 to 65536. This value is used to determine the amount of file metadata that can be cached by the client. Increasing the value can reduce network traffic and increase performance when many files are accessed. Try increasing this value to **1024**.

#### DirectoryCacheEntriesMax

`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\DirectoryCacheEntriesMax`

Applies to Windows 10 and Windows 11. The default is **16**, with a valid range of 1 to 4096. This value is used to determine the amount of directory information that can be cached by the client. Increasing the value can reduce network traffic and increase performance when large directories are accessed. Consider increasing this value to **1024**.

#### FileNotFoundCacheEntriesMax

`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\FileNotFoundCacheEntriesMax`

Applies to Windows 10 and Windows 11. The default is **128**, with a valid range of 1 to 65536. This value is used to determine the amount of file name information that can be cached by the client. Increasing the value can reduce network traffic and increase performance when many file names are accessed. Consider increasing this value to **2048**.

#### DormantFileLimit

`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\DormantFileLimit`

Applies to Windows 10 and Windows 11. The default is **1023**. This parameter specifies the maximum number of files that should be left open on a shared resource after the application has closed the file. Where many thousands of clients are connecting to SMB servers, consider reducing this value to **256**.: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019,

You can configure many of these SMB settings by using the [Set-SmbClientConfiguration](/powershell/module/smbshare/set-smbclientconfiguration?view=win10-ps&preserve-view=true) and [Set-SmbServerConfiguration](/powershell/module/smbshare/set-smbserverconfiguration?view=win10-ps&preserve-view=true) Windows PowerShell cmdlets. Registry-only settings can be configured by using Windows PowerShell as well, as in the following example:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters" RequireSecuritySignature -Value 0 -Force
```

### More settings from the Windows Restricted Traffic Limited Functionality Baseline guidance

Microsoft has released a baseline, created using the same procedures as the [Windows Security Baselines](/windows/device-security/windows-security-baselines), for environments that are either not connected directly to the Internet, or wish to reduce data sent to Microsoft and other services.

The [Windows Restricted Traffic Limited Functionality Baseline](/windows/privacy/manage-connections-from-windows-operating-system-components-to-microsoft-services) settings are called out in the group policy table with an asterisk.

### Disk cleanup

Disk cleanup can be especially helpful with gold/master image virtual desktop implementations. After the gold/master image is prepared, updated, and configured, one of the last tasks to perform is disk cleanup. The optimization scripts on Github.com have PowerShell code to perform common disk cleanup tasks

> [!NOTE]
> Disk cleanup settings and are in the Settings category "System" called "Storage." By default, Storage Sense runs when a low disk free space threshold is reached.
>
> To learn more about how to use Storage Sense with Azure custom VHD images, see [Prepare and customize a master VHD image](/azure/virtual-desktop/set-up-customize-master-image).
>
> For Azure Virtual Desktop session host that use Windows Enterprise or Windows Enterprise multi-session, we recommend disabling Storage Sense. You can disable Storage Sense in the Settings menu under **Storage**.

Here are suggestions for various disk cleanup tasks. These should all be tested before implementing:

1. Storage Sense may be utilized manually or automatically. For more information on Storage Sense, see [Manage drive space with Storage Sense](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-drive-space-with-storage-sense-654f6ada-7bfc-45e5-966b-e24aded96ad5).

1. Manually cleanup temporary files and logs. From an elevated command prompt, run these commands:

   1. `Del C:\*.tmp /s`
   1. `C:\*.etl /s`
   1. `C:\*.evtx /s`

   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem -Path c:\ -Include *.tmp, *.dmp, *.etl, *.evtx, thumbcache*.db, *.log -File -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Remove-Item -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

   Remove-Item -Path $env:ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\Temp\* -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

   Remove-Item -Path $env:ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportArchive\* -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

   Remove-Item -Path $env:ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportQueue\* -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

   Clear-RecycleBin -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

   Clear-BCCache -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   ```

1. Delete any unused profiles on the system by running the following command:

    `wmic path win32_UserProfile where LocalPath="C:\\users\\<users>" Delete`
