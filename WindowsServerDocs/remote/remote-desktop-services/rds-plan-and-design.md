# Plan and design your Remote Desktop Services environment

A highly scalable Remote Desktop deployment requires the use of specific patterns and practices.
Designing for optimal performance and scale-out is key. Use the scenarios below to help you envision, architect, and continually refine your deployment.

Use the following information to plan and design your deployment:

- [Build anywhere](rds-plan-build-anywhere.md)
- [Network guidance](network-guidance.md)
- [Access from anywhere](rds-plan-access-from-anywhere.md)
- [High availability](rds-plan-high-availability.md)
- [MultiFactor Authentication](rds-plan-mfa.md)
- [Secure data storage](rds-plan-secure-data-storage.md)
- [GPU acceleration](rds-graphics-virtualization.md)
- [Connect from any device](rds-plan-connect-from-any-device.md)
- [Choose how you pay](rds-plan-choose-how-you-pay.md)

Be sure to also review the [Desktop Hosting Reference Architecture](desktop-hosting-reference-architecture.md), which provides an overview of the Remote Desktop architecture and helps you plan a hybrid RDS environment that includes Azure infrastructure.
