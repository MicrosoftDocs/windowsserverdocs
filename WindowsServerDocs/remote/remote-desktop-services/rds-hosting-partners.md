# Remote Desktop Services hosting partners and assessment

Recently, Microsoft delivered a new learning path within the Microsoft Partner Network: "Hosting Windows Desktop and Applications using Remote Desktop Services in Azure."

If you are a Microsoft partner and want to be included in the list of partners who have passed the assessment, here are the steps you can take to complete the learning path:

1. Become a [Microsoft Partner](https://partner.microsoft.com/), if you're not already.
2. Watch the [Hosting Windows and Applications using Remote Desktop Services in Azure training session](https://mspartnerlp.partner.microsoft.com/LearningPath/LearningPath/DLPaths?trackId=2915&rowId=3603).
3. Take the [technical assessment](https://mspartnerlp.partner.microsoft.com/LearningPath/LearningPath/DLPaths?trackId=1660&rowId=2220&trackPathId=9871).
4. Make sure you meet the [requirements for the Cloud Platform competency](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/cloud-platform-competency).
