# Manage your personal desktop session collections

Use the following information to manage a personal desktop session collection in Remote Desktop Services.

## Manually assign a user to a personal session host
Use the **Set-RDPersonalSessionDesktopAssignment** cmdlet to manually assign a user to a personal session host server in the collection. The cmdlet supports the following parameters:

-CollectionName \<string\>

-ConnectionBroker \<string\>

-User \<string\>

-Name \<string\>

- **–CollectionName** - specifies the name of the personal session desktop collection. This parameter is required.
- **–ConnectionBroker** - specifies the Remote Desktop Connection Broker (RD Connection Broker) server for your Remote Desktop deployment. If you don't supply a value, the cmdlet uses the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the local computer.
- **–User** - specifies the user account to associate with the personal session desktop, in DOMAIN\User format. This parameter is required.
- **–Name** - specifies the name of the session host server. This parameter is required. The session host identified here must be a member of the collection that the **-CollectionName** parameter specifies.

The **Import-RDPersonalSessionDesktopAssignment** cmdlet imports associations between user accounts and personal session desktops from a text file. The cmdlet supports the following parameters:

-CollectionName \<string\>

-ConnectionBroker \<string\>

-Path \<string>

**–Path** specifies the path and file name of a file to import.

## Removing a User Assignment from a Personal Session Host
Use the **Remove-RDPersonalSessionDesktopAssignment** cmdlet to remove the association between a personal session desktop and a user. The cmdlet supports the following parameters:

-CollectionName \<string\>

-ConnectionBroker \<string\>

-Force

-Name \<string\>

-User \<string\>

**–Force** forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

## Query user assignments
Use the **Get-RDPersonalSessionDesktopAssignment** cmdlet to get a list of personal session desktops and associated user accounts. The cmdlet supports the following parameters:

-CollectionName \<string\>

-ConnectionBroker \<string\>

-User \<string\>

-Name \<string\>

You can run the cmdlet to query by collection name, user name, or by session desktop name. If you specify only the **–CollectionName** parameter, the cmdlet returns a list of session hosts and associated users. If you also specify the **–User** parameter, the session host associated with that user is returned. If you provide the **–Name** parameter, the user associated with that session host is returned.


The **Export-RDPersonalPersonalDesktopAssignment** cmdlet exports the current associations between users and personal virtual desktops to a text file. The cmdlet supports the following parameters:

-CollectionName \<string\>

-ConnectionBroker \<string\>

-Path \<string\>


All new cmdlets support the common parameters: -Verbose, -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -OutBuffer, and -OutVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_commonparameters).
