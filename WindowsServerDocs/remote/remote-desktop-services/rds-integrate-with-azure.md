# Remote Desktop Services - Integrating with Azure services

Windows Server 2016 combines the powerful secure delivery of desktops and apps through Remote Desktop Services with the flexible, scalable services provided by Microsoft Azure. You can deploy RDS with Azure services to help reduce infrastructure maintenance cost for on-premises servers, increase stability by using Azure services to ensure high availability, improve security by using Multi-factor Authentication, and improve your users' experience by using existing identities to access resources in RDS.

Use the following information to integrate Azure into your Remote Desktop deployment:

- [Learn how to use Multi-factor Authentication with RDS](/azure/multi-factor-authentication/nps-extension-remote-desktop-gateway)
- [Integrate Azure AD Domain Services with your RDS deployment](rds-azure-adds.md)
- [Publish Remote Desktop with Azure AD Application Proxy](/azure/active-directory/application-proxy-publish-remote-desktop)

To see how these services simplify the architecture of your Remote Desktop deployment, check out [RDS architectures with unique Azure PaaS roles](desktop-hosting-logical-architecture.md#rds-architectures-with-unique-azure-paas-roles).
