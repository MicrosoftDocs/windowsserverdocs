# Additional Remote Desktop resources

In addition to the information here in the Windows Server 2016 library, you can use the following resources to learn about and get help with Remote Desktop Services:

- Participate in general discussions about Remote Desktop Services in the [Windows Server Community discussion space](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-server/ct-p/Windows-Server).
- Follow the latest updates for the Remote Desktop clients and Azure Virtual Desktop in the [Azure Virtual Desktop blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-virtual-desktop-blog/bg-p/AzureVirtualDesktopBlog).
