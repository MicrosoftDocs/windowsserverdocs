# Additional Remote Desktop resources

In addition to the information here in the Windows Server 2016 library, you can use the following resources to learn about and get help with Remote Desktop Services:

- Participate in general discussions about Remote Desktop Services in the [RDS TechNet forum](https://aka.ms/technetforum-rds).
- For discussion about Remote Desktop applications/clients for Windows, Android, iOS, and Mac, visit the [Remote Desktop clients TechNet forum](https://aka.ms/technetforum-rdc).
- For MultiPoint, check out the [MultiPoint TechNet forum](https://aka.ms/multipoint-forum).

If you have ideas about Remote Desktop Services that you want to share with us, post a topic in [our UserVoice forum](https://aka.ms/uservoice-rds).
