# Create a MultiPoint Dashboard User Account
Create MultiPoint Dashboard user accounts for those users who will regularly access stations, but who will not manage your MultiPoint Services system. Users with MultiPoint Dashboard user accounts can run most applications and save files, but cannot run MultiPoint Manager. To see who has MultiPoint Dashboard user access, in MultiPoint Manager, click the **Users** tab. MultiPoint Dashboard user accounts are displayed in the **Account Type** column as **MultiPoint Dashboard User**.  
  
If your MultiPoint Services users will store private documents in Windows, each user should log on to the MultiPoint Services system using a unique user name and password.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> For more information about issues you, as an *administrative user*, should consider as you create and manage user accounts, see the [User Account Considerations](User-Account-Considerations.md) topic.  
  
#### To create a MultiPoint Dashboard user account  
  
1.  In MultiPoint Manager, click the **Users** tab.  
  
2.  Under **User Tasks**, click **Add user account**. The **Add User Account** wizard opens.  
  
3.  In the **User account** field, type a logon name for the user.  
  
4.  In the **Full name** field, type the name of the user in whatever format you prefer, such as given name, full name, or a nickname.  
  
5.  In the **Create password** field, type a password for the user. This password should only be known to you and the user, and you should store this information in a secure location. The password can only be changed by an administrative user.  
  
6.  In the **Confirm password** field, retype the password, and then click **Next**.  
  
7.  On the level of access page, select **MultiPoint Dashboard user**, and then click **Next**.  
  
8.  Click **Finish**.
