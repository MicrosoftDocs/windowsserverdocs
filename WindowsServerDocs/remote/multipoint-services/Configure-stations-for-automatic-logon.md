# Configure stations for automatic logon
If you want your stations to be available to anyone – and your users do not need private folders to store their personal data or personalized desktops – you can configure the stations for automatic logon. Auto-logon automatically logs on a user account that has been specified in the auto-logon settings when the MultiPoint Services starts.

1.  From the **Start** screen, open **MultiPoint Manager**.

2.  Click the **Stations** tab, and then click the name of the station that you want to configure for auto-logon.

3.  In the right pane, click **Configure auto-logon**.

    The Configure Auto-Logon page opens.

4.  Select the **Auto-logon using the following information** check box, and then enter the user account and password to use for auto-logon. Click **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The user account that you use for auto-logon must have a password.

> [!NOTE]
> To temporarily log on to a station that is set up for automatic logon with a different user account, hover over the top right corner of the screen to display a vertical menu, click the Settings charm, click the Power icon, and then hold the SHIFT key and click **Disconnect**. Hold down the SHIFT key until a logon prompt appears.
