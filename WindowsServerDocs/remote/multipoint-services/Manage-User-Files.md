# Manage User Files
Both standard users and administrative users at MultiPoint Services stations can save documents in Windows Explorer libraries and folders. A library is a collection of items, such as files and folders. Common libraries in Windows Explorer include **Documents**, **Music**, **Pictures**, and **Videos**. When working with libraries, there are two options for storing documents:

-   Store documents privately so that they are accessible only to the user who stored them in a library or folder. Note that administrative users can access privately stored documents of standard users. However, standard users cannot access privately stored documents of administrative users. For more information about keeping content private, see the [Keep Files Private](Keep-Files-Private.md) topic.

-   Store documents publicly so that they are accessible to all users on the MultiPoint Services system. For more information about sharing content with other users, see the [Share Files](Share-Files.md) topic.

The **Documents** library, by default, includes two folders: **My Documents** (which is private) and **Public Documents** (which is public). Other document libraries contain similar pairs of private and public folders. All administrative and standard users of a MultiPoint Services system should understand how the Windows Explorer location at which they put documents and other files can affect the privacy or public access of those files.

You can also share content with other users by using a USB storage device such as a USB flash drive or mass storage device (external hard disk). For more information about sharing content with storage devices, see the [Save and Share Files on a USB Flash Drive](Save-and-Share-Files-on-a-USB-Flash-Drive.md) topic.
