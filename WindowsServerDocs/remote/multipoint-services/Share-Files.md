# Share Files
You can share content with other MultiPoint Services users by storing the content in a public folder in Windows Explorer. All content that is stored in public folders in Windows Explorer in a MultiPoint Services system is accessible to all users on the MultiPoint Services system.  
  
You can also share content by storing it on removable storage devices, as described in [Save and Share Files on a USB Flash Drive](Save-and-Share-Files-on-a-USB-Flash-Drive.md).  
  
For information about keeping content private, see [Keep Files Private](Keep-Files-Private.md).  
  
## To share content with other users by using Public folders  
  
Share content with other users by storing it in the **Public Documents**, **Public Music**, and other public folders in Windows Explorer libraries. 
  
You can also share files across multiple computers that are running MultiPoint Services on a network by creating a new folder, and then sharing it.  
  
## To share files across multiple computers in a MultiPoint Services network  
  
1.  Right-click on a desktop, and then click **New**.  
  
2.  Click **Folder**, and then type a name for the folder.  
  
3.  Double-click the folder to open it.  
  
4.  Click **Share with**, and then click **Specific people**.  
  
5.  Select specific users, or click **Everyone**.
