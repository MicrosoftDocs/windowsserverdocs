# Share Files
You can share content with other MultiPoint Services users by storing the content in a public folder in Windows Explorer. All content that is stored in public folders in Windows Explorer in a MultiPoint Services system is accessible to all users on the MultiPoint Services system.

You can also share content by storing it on removable storage devices, as described in [Save and Share Files on a USB Flash Drive](Save-and-Share-Files-on-a-USB-Flash-Drive.md).

For information about keeping content private, see [Keep Files Private](Keep-Files-Private.md).

## To share content with other users by using Public folders

Share content with other users by storing it in the **Public Documents**, **Public Music**, and other public folders in Windows Explorer libraries.

You can also share files across multiple computers that are running MultiPoint Services on a network by creating a new folder, and then sharing it.

## To share files across multiple computers in a MultiPoint Services network

1.  Right-click on a desktop, and then click **New**.

2.  Click **Folder**, and then type a name for the folder.

3.  Double-click the folder to open it.

4.  Click **Share with**, and then click **Specific people**.

5.  Select specific users, or click **Everyone**.
