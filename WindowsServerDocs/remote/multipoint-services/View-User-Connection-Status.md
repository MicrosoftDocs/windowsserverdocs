# View User Connection Status
Use the **Stations** tab to determine the status of a standard or other administrative user's connection to a MultiPoint Services station.

Status values include the following:

-   **Logged on**: A user session that is active on a station

-   **Suspended**: A user session that is suspended, but is still active on the computer. The user's desktop session is preserved until the user logs on again

-   **Logged off**: A user who is logged off is not displayed on the **Stations** tab

To view station status, open MultiPoint Manager in stations mode, and then click **Stations**.
