# Deploy a new Windows MultiPoint Services system
The topics in this section explain how to set up your MultiPoint Services System. You will install and configure a MultiPoint server; set up your stations; install drivers, updates, and software; optionally join a domain; activate MultiPoint Server; and add client access licenses (CALs) for each station.
