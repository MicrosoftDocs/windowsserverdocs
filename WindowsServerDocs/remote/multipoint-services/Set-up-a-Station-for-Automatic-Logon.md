# Set up a Station for Automatic Logon
Auto-logon enables each station to be automatically logged on when the computer that is running MultiPoint Services starts, and display the desktop. An administrative user can set this feature for individual stations or for all stations.

2.  Click the name of the station you want to automatically log on.  
  
3.  Under  **Tasks**, click **Configure station**. The **Configure Stations** page opens.  
  
4.  Select **Auto-logon using the following information**, and then enter a **User account** name.  
  
5.  Enter the password for the user account, and then re-enter the password to confirm it.  
  
6.  Click **OK**. The page closes. The account name is displayed in the **Auto-logon** column.
