2.  Click the name of the station you want to automatically log on.

3.  Under  **Tasks**, click **Configure station**. The **Configure Stations** page opens.

4.  Select **Auto-logon using the following information**, and then enter a **User account** name.

5.  Enter the password for the user account, and then re-enter the password to confirm it.

6.  Click **OK**. The page closes. The account name is displayed in the **Auto-logon** column.
