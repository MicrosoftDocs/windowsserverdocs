# Install updates
We recommend that you install updates if available. Installing updates requires an Internet connection.

1.  From the **Start** screen, open **Control Panel**.

2.  In Control Panel, type **updates**, and then click **Check for updates**.

3.  If the Windows Update website lists any updates that are needed on your computer, install the updates.
