# View Options for Session Thumbnails in MultiPoint Dashboard
An easy way to monitor user activities on individual desktops is to view thumbnail images of each active desktop on your MultiPoint Services system. By default, images of desktops are displayed in MultiPoint Dashboard on the **Home** tab.  
  
Using MultiPoint Dashboard, you can do the following:  
  
- View a user's desktop more closely by enlarging its view in the dashboard.  
- Change the size of the thumbnail images that are displayed in the dashboard. Three sizes are available for view: small, medium, or large. Medium is the default setting.  
- View all desktops on the MultiPoint Services system, or choose a filtered view that shows active desktops.  
  
## To enlarge the view of a selected desktop in MultiPoint Dashboard  
  
1.  Click the **Home** tab, and then click the desktop you want to enlarge.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, click **Enlarge Selected**. The user's desktop opens in the dashboard.  
  
3.  When you are finished with the enlarged view, click Return to Desktops View.  
  
## To change the size of desktop thumbnails in MultiPoint Dashboard  
  
1.  Click the **Home** tab, and then select the desktop thumbnail you want to enlarge.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, click **Enlarge Selected**. The **Change Desktop Size** page opens.  
  
3.  Click the size you want (**Small**, **Medium**, or **Large**), and then click **OK**.  
  
## To show all desktops in MultiPoint Dashboard  
  
1.  Click the **Home** tab, and then click **Show** in the ribbon under **Desktops**..  
  
2.  Click **All**. All desktops are displayed in the dashboard.  
  
3.  To change back to the filtered view, click **Show**, and then click **Filtered View**.  

>[!NOTE]
