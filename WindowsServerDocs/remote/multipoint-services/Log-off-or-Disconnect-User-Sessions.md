# Log off or Disconnect User Sessions
MultiPoint Services users can log on and log off of their desktop sessions as they would with any Windows session. Users can also disconnect or suspend their session so that the MultiPoint Services station is not being used, but their session remains active in the MultiPoint Services system's computer memory.

In addition, administrative users can end a user's session if the user has stepped away from their MultiPoint Services session or has forgotten to log off of the system.

## Logging off or disconnecting a session
The following table describes the different options that you or any user can use to log off, suspend, or end a session.
