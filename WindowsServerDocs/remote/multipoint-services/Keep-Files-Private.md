# Keep Files Private
This topic applies to content, such as documents, that you \(as an *administrative user*\) and *standard users* do not want to share with other users in a MultiPoint Services system.  

For more information about privacy in MultiPoint Services, see [Privacy and Security Considerations](Privacy-and-Security-Considerations.md).
  
## To keep content private in Windows Explorer  
  
To keep your documents and other content private, you should save your work in Windows Explorer in the **Documents** library in the **My Documents** folder. The **My Documents** folder is, by default, a private folder. Note, however, that administrative users have access to private folders in Windows Explorer.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
> While an external storage device, such as a USB flash drive, is connected to a USB port on the host or on a USB hub that is not a station hub, it is viewable by any standard or administrative user logged onto the MultiPoint Services system. If you have privacy or security concerns about the content stored on an external storage device, connect it only to a station hub on the MultiPoint Services system. For information about how to use USB storage devices, see the [Save and Share Files on a USB Flash Drive](Save-and-Share-Files-on-a-USB-Flash-Drive.md) topic.
