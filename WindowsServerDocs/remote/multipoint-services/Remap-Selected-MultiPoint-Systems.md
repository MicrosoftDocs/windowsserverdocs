# Remap Selected MultiPoint Systems
Remapping stations in MultiPoint Dashboard allows you to associate keyboards and mice to monitors. Local user stations are suspended while a MultiPoint Services system is remapped.

> [!CAUTION]
> Remapping is commonly used for troubleshooting purposes. Station settings, such as name and auto\-logon information, are erased during the remapping process.

#### To remap a MultiPoint Services system

1.  In MultiPoint Services, click the **Systems** tab.

2.  Click the thumbnail image of the server you want to remap, and then, on the **Hardware** tab, click **Remap Selected System**.
