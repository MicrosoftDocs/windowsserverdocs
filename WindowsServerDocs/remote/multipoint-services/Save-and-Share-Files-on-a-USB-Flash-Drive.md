# Save and Share Files on a USB Flash Drive
In addition to being able to share content using Public folders in Windows Explorer, you can also share content using a USB storage device, such as a USB flash drive or mass storage device. When you attach a USB storage device directly to the host computer or to a USB hub that is not a station hub, that storage device will appear as a removable storage device to all users, *standard users* and *administrative users*, across the MultiPoint Services system.  
  
You can also use a removable storage device to save and store private documents in a private folder in Windows Explorer, such as the **My Documents** folder in the **Documents** library.  
  
 > [!NOTE]  
 > The Dashboard user can block the usage of USB storage. For more information, see [Block or Unblock USB Storage](Block-or-Unblock-USB-Storage.md).  
  
## To share content that is stored directly on a removable storage device  
  
1.  Connect the removable storage device to an open USB port on the host computer or a USB hub that is not a *station hub* in the MultiPoint Services system.  
2.  Instruct users at other *stations* to navigate to and open the removable storage device drive in Windows Explorer. Likewise, other users can share content with you from their own removable storage devices the same way.  
  
## To share content that is stored on a removable storage device by using Public folders  
  
1.  Connect the removable storage device to an open USB port on the host computer or a USB hub that is not a *station hub* in the MultiPoint Services system.  
2.  Copy the content you want to share to a public folder in Windows Explorer, such as **Public Documents** in the **Documents** library.  
  
## To privately work with content that is stored on a USB storage device  
  
Connect the removable storage device to an open USB port on your station hub.
