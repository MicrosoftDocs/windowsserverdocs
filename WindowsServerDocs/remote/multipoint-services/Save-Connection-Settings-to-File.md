# Save Connection Settings to File
Using Remote Desktop, you can connect to a MultiPoint Services system from another computer. If the remote computer supports Remote Desktop Protocol, the connection to the computer can be established automatically.  
  
There are three types of connection files you can create:  
  
- **MultiPoint Manager connection file**:  Allows MultiPoint Manager to be run on another computer as a remote application.  
  
- **MultiPoint Dashboard connection file**: Allows MultiPoint Dashboard to be run on another computer as a remote application.  
  
- **Remote station connection file**:  Allows another computer to connect to the MultiPoint Services system as a remote station.  
  
## To save system connection settings to a file  
  
1.  Open MultiPoint Manager in station mode, and then click the **Home** tab.  
  
2.  In the **Computer** column, click the name of the computer for which you want to save the connection settings to a file.  
  
3.  Under *computer name***Tasks**, click **Save connections to file**. The **Save Connection Settings to File** page is displayed.  
  
4.  Choose the type of connection file you want to create, and then click **OK**.  
  
5.  Choose the folder where you want to save the file, edit the **File name** if preferred, and then click **Save**.
