# Create a Standard User Account
Create *standard user accounts* for those users who will regularly access stations, but who will not manage your MultiPoint Services system. Users with standard user accounts can run most applications and save files, but cannot run MultiPoint Manager. To see who has standard user access, in MultiPoint Manager, click the **Users** tab. Standard user accounts are displayed in the **Account Type** column as **Standard**.  
  
If your MultiPoint Services users will store private documents in Windows, each user should log on to the MultiPoint Services system using a unique user name and password.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> For more information about issues you, as an *administrative user*, should consider as you create and manage user accounts, see the [User Account Considerations](User-Account-Considerations.md) topic.  
  
#### To create a standard user account  
  
1.  In MultiPoint Manager, click the **Users** tab.  
  
2.  Under **User Tasks**, click **Add user account**. The **Add User Account** wizard opens.  
  
3.  In the **User account** field, type a logon name for the user. Typically, the logon user name is the first and last name written together without spaces, or the first initial and last name written together without a space.  
  
4.  In the **Full name** field, type the name of the user in whatever format you prefer, such as given name, full name, or a nickname.  
  
5.  In the **Create password** field, type a password for the user. This password should only be known to you and the user, and you should store this information in a secure location. The password can only be changed by an administrative user.  
  
6.  In the **Confirm password** field, retype the password, and then click **Next**.  
  
7.  On the level of access page, select **Standard user**, and then click **Next**.  
  
8.  Click **Finish**.
