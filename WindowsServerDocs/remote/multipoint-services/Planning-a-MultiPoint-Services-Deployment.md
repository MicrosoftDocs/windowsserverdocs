# Planning a MultiPoint Services Deployment
MultiPoint Services enables multiple stations to be connected to one computer. Multiple users can then share one computer at the same time. Each station consists of a station hub, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. MultiPoint Services includes the MultiPoint Manager application, which helps you, as an administrative user, to monitor and manage MultiPoint stations, and the MultiPoint Dashboard application, which provides day-to-day administrative functionality.
