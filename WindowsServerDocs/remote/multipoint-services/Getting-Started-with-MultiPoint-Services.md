# Getting Started with MultiPoint Services
Your MultiPoint Services system allows many users to use multiple stations that are physically connected by using station hubs to only one computer. Each station typically consists of a station hub, mouse, keyboard, and video monitor. Each user at a MultiPoint Services station experiences a unique Windows computing session that you can manage using MultiPoint Manager.  
  
The components of a MultiPoint Services system include the following:  
  
-   MultiPoint Services system software, which supports multiple monitors, keyboards, mouse devices, and other devices on the computer.  
  
-   The MultiPoint Manager application, which lets you monitor and take actions on MultiPoint Services stations.  
  
-   Maintenance and management tools.  
  
-   The MultiPoint Dashboard application, which lets you complete daily tasks, such as communicating with other users.  
  
Information about how to manage MultiPoint Services stations with MultiPoint Manager and MultiPoint Dashboard is provided in this Help file.  
  
## Overview of MultiPoint Manager  
MultiPoint Manager provides four tabs to use when you are managing the MultiPoint Services stations. Each tab, and the tasks that you can perform on them, is described in more detail in each Help topic.  
  
The tabs are as follows:  
  
-   **Home tab:** Switch modes to perform administrative tasks, add or remove MultiPoint servers, restart or shut down the computer, enable disk protection, add client access licenses, remap stations, and get help or support. For more information, see the [Manage System Tasks Using MultiPoint Manager](Manage-System-Tasks-Using-MultiPoint-Manager.md) topic.  
  
-   **Stations tab:** View users' *desktop* status and *end* or *suspend* user sessions. For more information, see the [Manage User Stations](Manage-User-Stations.md) topic.  
  
-   **Users tab:** Create and manage *standard user accounts* and *administrative user accounts*. For more information, see the [Manage User Accounts](Manage-User-Accounts.md) topic.  
  
-   **Virtual Desktops tab:** Enable virtual desktop roles. For more information, see the [Manage Virtual Desktops](Manage-Virtual-Desktops.md) topic.  
  
## MultiPoint Server management and maintenance  
After your MultiPoint Services system is set up, you can use MultiPoint Manager to manage MultiPoint Services.  
  
Types of actions you can perform using MultiPoint Manager include the following:  
  
-   **Adding user accounts:** Use MultiPoint Manager to create standard and administrative user accounts.  
  
-   **Editing server settings:** You can configure your MultiPoint Services system to start in console mode, allow an account to have multiple sessions, assign a unique IP address to each station, and other tasks.  
  
-   **Switching to console mode:** You can change the MultiPoint Services system to console mode in order to install new software on your MultiPoint Services system. You can specify that all users can run the software, or that only you can use the software, depending on the installation and licensing options of the software.  
  
-   **Troubleshooting:** If you experience problems with MultiPoint Services, check the [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md) section to find topics that can help you fix the problem.  
  
## Overview of MultiPoint Dashboard  
MultiPoint Dashboard features a ribbon experience where you can choose between two tabs to access common daily tasks.  
  
The tabs are as follows:  
  
-   **Home tab:** Block or unblock stations, set web limiting options, project desktops to other desktops, launch or close applications, communicate via instant messaging, assist other users through remote desktop control, adjust desktop thumbnail views, and enable or disable instant messaging and application auto-launch. For more information, see the [Manage User Desktops Using MultiPoint Dashboard](Manage-User-Desktops-Using-MultiPoint-Dashboard.md) topic.  
  
-   **Systems tab:** Restart, shut down, or remap either all or selected systems. For more information, see the [Manage MultiPoint Systems Using MultiPoint Dashboard](Manage-MultiPoint-Systems-Using-MultiPoint-Dashboard.md) topic.  
  
## Daily use of your MultiPoint Server system  
As you begin to use MultiPoint Services daily, there is information about how to use MultiPoint Services that you might want to share with the users on your MultiPoint Services system. This information includes the following:  
  
**Sharing content and keeping content private:**  
  
-   A user can save a file or document to a private folder that can be viewed only by that user.  
  
-   Users can also save documents to a public folder that is accessible to all users on the MultiPoint Services system.  
  
-   It is important for MultiPoint Services users to know that administrative users have access to all files and documents on the system, even if they are stored privately in a user's personal folder.  
  
For more information about how to save and manage private and public content, see the [Manage User Files](Manage-User-Files.md) topic.  
  
**Information about a user's MultiPoint Services session:**  
  
-   Each user has a user name and password, and a unique desktop *session* on the MultiPoint Services system.  
  
-   A *standard user* is not an *administrative user* on the MultiPoint Services system. Standard users cannot install some types of software, but can save files and change desktop settings, except for the screen resolution. Any desktop changes the user makes are present when the user logs on again.  
  
-   Users can disconnect from one station and log back on to their session on a different station without losing their work. For more information, see the [Suspend and Leave User Session Active](Suspend-and-Leave-User-Session-Active.md) topic.  
  
-   A standard user's session (or all user sessions) can be disconnected or logged off by the administrative user through MultiPoint Manager. For more information, see the [Manage User Desktops](manage-user-desktops-using-multipoint-dashboard.md) topic.  
  
-   If a user forgets a password, you can reset the password from the **Users** tab, which uses standard Windows user account management functionality. For more information, see the [Update or Delete a User Account](Update-or-Delete-a-User-Account.md) topic.
