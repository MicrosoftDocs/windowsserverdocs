# Privacy and Security Considerations
Because your MultiPoint Services system is, by design, a shared computing environment, you should consider the following privacy and safe computing issues.  
  
## Privacy in a MultiPoint Services system  
The capabilities of MultiPoint Services to share or keep private user documents may be new to you, other *administrative users*, *MultiPoint Dashboard users*, or *standard users* on your MultiPoint Services system. In MultiPoint Manager, you can see screen activity on all active standard user desktops. Standard users are notified when they log on to the MultiPoint Services system, and must accept this monitoring in order to proceed. For more information about how to share content or keep it private, see [Manage User Files](Manage-User-Files.md).  
  
## Security in a MultiPoint Services system  
As an administrative user of your MultiPoint Services system, become familiar with the security and safe computing capabilities in Windows. These include Windows automatic updating and support for firewalls, virus protection, and spyware and other malware protection.   
  
Shared computing resources, such as a MultiPoint Services system, may be prone to security threats due to the potentially large number of users of the system and the easy access to station hardware devices and wires. A malicious user may attempt to insert a keystroke logger or similar device at a MultiPoint Services station hub. If you see devices attached to any ports on your MultiPoint Services system that you do not recognize, consider it suspect and follow the security escalation guidelines of your organization.
