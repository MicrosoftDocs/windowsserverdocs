# Project a Station to Other Stations
As a MultiPoint Dashboard User, you can project your desktop to a single user's station or all users' (non-administrator) stations. This feature is useful when you want to demonstrate a task to a user or set of users.  
  
## To project your desktop to a standard user's station  
  
1.  In MultiPoint Dashboard, click the thumbnail image of the desktop to which you want to project your station.  
2.  On the **Home** tab, click **Your Desktop**, and then click **Project Your Desktop to Selected Desktop(s)**.  
3.  To end the projection, click **Stop** (either on the **Projection** tab or in the right-hand corner below the ribbon).  
  
## To project your desktop to all stations  
  
1.  In MultiPoint Dashboard, on the **Home** tab, click **Your Desktop**, and then click **Project Your Desktop to All Desktop(s)**.  
  
2.  To end the projection, click **Stop** (either on the **Projection** tab or in the right-hand corner below the ribbon).  
  
## To project a different desktop to all desktops  
  
1.  Click the thumbnail image of the desktop you want to project to all desktops.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, click **Selected Desktop**, and then click **Selected Desktop**. The selected desktop is displayed on all desktops.  
  
3.  To end the projection, click **Stop** (either on the **Projection** tab or in the right-hand corner below the ribbon).
