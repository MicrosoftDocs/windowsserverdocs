# Add or Remove Computers
You can add other computers or remove computers from your MultiPoint Services system by using MultiPoint Manager. Adding other PCs to MultiPoint Manager allows the MultiPoint Dashboard to orchestrate any user's session when logged on to that PC in the same way it can for MultiPoint stations.

## To add or remove servers in MultiPoint

1.  Open MultiPoint Manager in station mode, and then click the **Home** tab.

2.  Under *computer name* **Tasks**, click **Add or remove MultiPoint servers**. The **Add or Remove MultiPoint Servers** screen launches and begins discovering other servers on the local network subnet that can be managed with MultiPoint Manager.

3.  Do one of the following:

    -   **To add a server:** In the **Available** list, click a server that you want to manage with MultiPoint Manager, and then click **Add**. If the administrator user account and password for the server are different than the account you are currently logged on with, you are prompted to provide the account information.

    -   **To add a server that is not on the subnet:** In the **MultiPoint Server name** field, type the name of the server you want to add, and then click **Manually Add**.

    -   **To remove a server:** In the **Managed** list, click a server that you want to remove from management, and then click **Remove**.

## To add or remove other computers

1.  Open MultiPoint Manager in station mode, and then click the **Home** tab.

2.  Under **Home Tasks**, click **Add or remove personal computers**. The **Add or Remove Personal Computers** screen launches and begins discovering other computers on the local network subnet that can be managed with MultiPoint Services.

3.  Do one of the following:

    -   **To add a computer:** In the **Available** list, click a computer that you want to manage with MultiPoint Services, and then click **Add**. When adding a computer, you are prompted to provide the account information.

    -   **To add a computer that is not on the subnet:** In the **Personal Computer name** field, type the name of the computer you want to add, and then click **Manually Add**.

    -   **To remove a computer:** In the **Managed** list, click a computer that you want to remove from management, and then click **Remove**.
