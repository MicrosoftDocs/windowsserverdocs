# Remap All Stations
Remapping stations allows you to associate keyboards and mice to monitors. When you remap all stations, the original settings, such as name and auto-logon information, are erased. All local user stations are suspended while the remapping takes place.

1.  Open MultiPoint Manager in station mode, and then click the **Home** tab.
2.  Under **Tasks**, click **Remap all stations**.
3. Follow the instructions on the station screens to associate the keyboards to the stations in your system.
