# Take Control of a User Session
As a MultiPoint Dashboard User, you can assist another user by remotely accessing his or her desktop using the Take Control feature.

1.  In MultiPoint Dashboard, on the **Home** tab, click the thumbnail image of the desktop for the user you want to assist.

2.  On the **Assist** tab, click **Take Control**. The user's desktop opens on your desktop, and then you can navigate their desktop using your keyboard and mouse.

3.  When you are finished assisting the user, click **Stop**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may need to minimize the user's desktop to see your MultiPoint Dashboard.
