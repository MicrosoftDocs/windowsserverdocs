# Add printers
Use the procedures in this topic to make a local printer available to all users on a MultiPoint Services system.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using domain accounts with MultiPoint Services, users can use any network printer from their stations.  
  
1.  Connect the printer to the Multipoint server.  
  
2.  Configure the printer as a shared printer:  
  
    1.  Log on to the MultiPoint Server computer as an administrator.  
  
    2.  From the **Start** screen, open **Control Panel**.  
  
    3.  In Control Panel, click **Hardware**, and then click **Devices and Printers**.  
  
    4.  Under **Printers and Faxes**, right-click the printer, and then click **Printer Properties**.  
  
    5.  Click the **Sharing** tab.  
  
    6.  Click **Share this printer**, specify a share name for the printer, and then click **OK**.  
  
Users logged on to any station that is connected to the Multipoint Services computer will be able to see and use the printer.
