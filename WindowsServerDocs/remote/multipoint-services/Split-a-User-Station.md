# Split a User Station
Any MultiPoint Services station monitor that has a resolution greater than 1024x768 can be split into two stations using the **Split station** task on the **Stations** tab. The desktop that is present on the monitor at the time that the split occurs moves to the left half of the monitor, and a new station is created on the right half of the same monitor. The new station must be mapped to a keyboard, mouse, and USB hub to complete its creation. After a station is split, a user can log on to the left station while another user logs on to the right station.

Benefits of using a split-screen station may include:

-   Reducing cost and space by accommodating more students on a MultiPoint Services system

-   Allowing two students to collaborate together, side-by-side on a project

-   Allowing a teacher to demonstrate a procedure on one station while a student follows along on the other station

> [!NOTE]
> When you split a station, the active session on the station is suspended. The user must log on to the station again to resume work after the split has occurred.

**To split a station:**

1.  In MultiPoint Manager, in station mode, click the **Stations** tab.

2.  In the **Station** column, click the name of the station you want to split.

3.  Under **Stations Tasks**, click **Split station**.

**To return a split station to a single station:**

1.  In MultiPoint Manager, in station mode, click the **Stations** tab.

2.  In the **Station** column, click the name of the station for which you want to end a split.

3.  Under **Stations Tasks**, click **Unsplit station**.
