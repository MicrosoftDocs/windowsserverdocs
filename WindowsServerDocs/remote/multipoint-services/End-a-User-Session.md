# End a User Session
You should end a user's session when you have to log the user off from the MultiPoint Services system to return the desktop to its default settings. The user receives a warning that the connection is about to end. You should end a user's connection when you want to:

-   Restart the MultiPoint Services system computer

-   Shut down the MultiPoint Services system computer

-   Switch modes

-   Log off a user who forgot to log off

To end user sessions:

1.  Open MultiPoint Manager in station mode, and then click the **Stations** tab.

2.  Do one of the following:

    -   To end a single user session, in the **User** column, select the session you want to end, and then, under **Tasks**, click **Log off**.

    -   To end all user sessions, under **Stations Tasks**, click **Log off all stations**.
