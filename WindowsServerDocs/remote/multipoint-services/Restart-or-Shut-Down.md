# Restart or Shut Down
You might have to restart the host computer and all of the *stations* in your MultiPoint Services system if instructed after you install hardware, software, and software updates. If you have added new hardware devices to a station, you might also want to associate the hardware devices to that station. For more information about how to *associate stations*, see the [Switch Between Modes](Switch-Between-Modes.md) topic.  
  
To turn off your MultiPoint Services system's computer safely, the computer must perform a shutdown process that closes any open programs, shuts down Windows, and turns off your computer and its associated *stations*. Do not just unplug or press the **Power** button to turn off your computer. You should shut down your computer at the end of the day and when you must install new hardware enclosed in the computer case.  If you add other hardware to the system, you may also need to shut down or restart the server.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Before you restart or shut down the computer that is running MultiPoint Services, all user *sessions* must have ended.
