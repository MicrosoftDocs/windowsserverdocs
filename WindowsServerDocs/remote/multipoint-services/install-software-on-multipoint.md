# Install software on your MultiPoint Services system
When you are logged on as an administrative user, you can install new programs either in console mode or, from a station, in station mode. However, we recommend that you install programs in console mode.

You can install new software on the computer running MultiPoint Server so that all users can run the software, or so that only you can use the software, depending on the installation and licensing options of the software.

1.  Log on to the MultiPoint Services computer as an administrator.

2.  Open MultiPoint Manager.

3.  Click the **Home** tab, and then click **Switch to console mode**.

4.  Log on as an administrator, and install your applications.

5.  After you finish installing applications, switch the computer back to station mode. To do this, on the **Home** tab, click **Switch to station mode**.
