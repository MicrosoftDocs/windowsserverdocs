# Log Off User Sessions
Standard users, MultiPoint Dashboard users, and administrative users can log on and log off of their desktop sessions as they would with any Windows session. In addition, administrative users and MultiPoint Dashboard users can end the user sessions on all of the monitored sessions on the MultiPoint Services system.

1.  In MultiPoint Dashboard, click the **Home** tab.

2.  Do one of the following:

    -   To log off a single user session or selected sessions, click the thumbnail image of the session you want to end, and then click the top-left drop-down menu. Click **Log Off Users**, and then click **Log Off Selected Users**. You can also see this option by right-clicking the selected thumbnails.

    -   To log off all user sessions, click the top-left drop-down menu, click **Log Off Users**, and then click **Log Off All Users**.
