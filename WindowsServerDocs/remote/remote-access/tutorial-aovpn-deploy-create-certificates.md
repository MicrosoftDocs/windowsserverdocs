# Tutorial: Configure Certificate Authority templates for Always On VPN

This tutorial shows you how to configure the Certificate Authority (CA) templates for the Always On VPN deployment. It continues the series to deploy Always On VPN in a sample environment. Previously in the series, you [deployed a sample infrastructure](tutorial-aovpn-deploy-setup.md).

The CA templates are used to issue certificates to the VPN server, NPS server, and users. The certificates are used to authenticate the VPN server and NPS server to clients, and to authenticate users to the VPN server.

In this tutorial, you:

> - Create a VPN server authentication template.
> - Create a NPS server authentication template.
> - Enroll and validate the user certificate.
> - Enroll and validate the VPN server certificate.
> - Enroll and validate the NPS server certificate.

Here's a description of the different templates:

| Template | Description |
|---|---|
| **User authentication template** | This template is used to issue user certificates for VPN clients. The user certificate is used to authenticate the user to the VPN server.<br /><br />With a user authentication template, you can improve certificate security by selecting upgraded compatibility levels and choosing the Microsoft Platform Crypto Provider. With the Microsoft Platform Crypto Provider, you can use a [Trusted Platform Module (TPM)](/windows/device-security/tpm/trusted-platform-module-overview) on client computers to secure the certificate. The user template is configured for autoenrollment. |
| **VPN server authentication template** | This template is used to issue a server certificate for the VPN server. The server certificate is used to authenticate the VPN server to the client.<br /><br />With a VPN server authentication template, you add the IP Security (IPsec) IKE Intermediate application policy. The IP Security (IPsec) IKE Intermediate application policy determines how the certificate can be used, it can allow the server to filter certificates if more than one certificate is available. Because VPN clients access this server from the public internet, the subject and alternative names are different than the internal server name. As a result, you don't configure the VPN server certificate for autoenrollment. |
| **NPS server authentication template** | This template is used to issue a server certificate for the NPS server. The NPS server certificate is used to authenticate the NPS server to the VPN server.<br /><br />With an NPS server authentication template, you copy the standard RAS and IAS Servers template, and scope it for your NPS server. The new NPS server template includes the server authentication application policy. |

Now you created the certificate templates you need to enroll and validate the certificates.

## Enroll and validate the user certificate

Group Policy is configured to autoenroll user certificates, so once the policy is applied to Windows client devices, they automatically enroll the user account for the correct certificate. You can then validate the certificate in the **Certificates** console on the local device.

To check the policy is applied and the certificate is enrolled:

1. Sign in to the Windows client device as the user that you created for the **VPN Users** group.

1. Open Command Prompt and run the following command. Alternatively, restart the Windows client device.

   ```cmd
   gpupdate /force
   ```

1. On the Start menu, type **certmgr.msc**, and press ENTER.

1. In the Certificates snap-in, under **Personal**, select **Certificates**. Your certificates appear in the details pane.

1. Right-click the certificate that has your current domain username, and then select **Open**.

1. On the **General** tab, confirm that the date listed under **Valid from** is today's date. If it isn't, you might have selected the wrong certificate.

1. Select **OK**, and close the Certificates snap-in.

## Enroll and validate the VPN server certificate

To enroll the VPN server's certificate:

1. On the VPN server's Start menu, type **certlm.msc** to open the Certificates snap-in, and press ENTER.

1. Right-click **Personal**, select **All Tasks** and then select **Request New Certificate** to start the Certificate Enrollment Wizard.

1. On the Before You Begin page, select **Next**.

1. On the Select Certificate Enrollment Policy page, select **Next**.

1. On the Request Certificates page, select **VPN Server Authentication**.

1. Under the VPN server check box, select **More information is required** to open the Certificate Properties dialog box.

1. Select the **Subject** tab and enter the following information in the **Subject name** section:

   1. For **Type** select *Common Name*.  
   1. For **Value**, enter the name of the external domain that clients use to connect to the VPN (for example, vpn.contoso.com).
   1. Select **Add**.

1. Select **OK** to close Certificate Properties.

1. Select **Enroll**.

1. Select **Finish**.

To validate the VPN server certificate:

1. In the Certificates snap-in, under **Personal**, select **Certificates**. Your listed certificates should appear in the details pane.

1. Right-click the certificate that has your VPN server's name, and then select **Open**.

1. On the **General** tab, confirm that the date listed under **Valid from** is today's date. If it isn't, you might have selected the wrong certificate.

1. On the **Details** tab, select **Enhanced Key Usage**, and verify that **IP security IKE intermediate** and **Server Authentication** display in the list.

1. Select **OK** to close the certificate.

## Enroll and validate the NPS certificate

To enroll the NPS certificate:

1. On the NPS server's Start menu, type **certlm.msc** to open the Certificates snap-in, and press ENTER.

1. Right-click **Personal**, select **All Tasks** and then select **Request New Certificate** to start the Certificate Enrollment Wizard.

1. On the Before You Begin page, select **Next**.

1. On the Select Certificate Enrollment Policy page, select **Next**.

1. On the Request Certificates page, select **NPS Server Authentication**.

1. Select **Enroll**.

1. Select **Finish**.

To validate the NPS certificate:

1. In the Certificates snap-in, under **Personal**, select **Certificates**. Your listed certificates should appear in the details pane.

1. Right-click the certificate that has your NPS server's name, and then select **Open**.

1. On the **General** tab, confirm that the date listed under **Valid from** is today's date. If it isn't, you might have selected the wrong certificate.

1. Select **OK**, and close the Certificates snap-in.
