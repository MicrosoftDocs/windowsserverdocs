# Troubleshooting Web Application Proxy

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016

**This content is relevant for the on-premises version of Web Application Proxy. To enable secure access to on-premises applications over the cloud, see the [Azure AD Application Proxy content](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy).**

This section provides troubleshooting procedures for Web Application Proxy including event explanations and solutions. There are three places where errors are displayed:

-   In the Web Application Proxy administrator console

    Each event ID listed in the administrator console can be viewed in the Windows Event Viewer and corresponding descriptions and solutions are found below.

    Open Event Viewer and look for events related to Web Application Proxy under **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **Web Application Proxy** > **Admin**

    ![Admin information, shown in the Event Viewer](media/Troubleshooting-Web-Application-Proxy/WebApplicationProxyTroubleshooting.png)

    If needed, detailed logs are available by turning on analytics and debugging logs and turning on the Web Application Proxy session log, found in the Windows Event Viewer under \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Web Application Proxy \ Admin.

-   In PowerShell errors

    Events for issues encountered during configuration are displayed in PowerShell.

    All errors are presented to the PowerShell user using standard PowerShell error prompts. All PowerShell commands are logged as events. All events that occur in PowerShell are listed in the Windows Event Viewer with the ID number 12016, and are defined below in the PowerShell section.

-   In the Best Practices Analyzer

    These events are described in the [Best Practices Analyzer for Web Application Proxy](assetId:///995f5cea-e334-4ce6-a14c-6a2d03c0c79a)

## PowerShell Messages

|Event or symptom|Possible cause|Resolution|
|--------------------|------------------|--------------|
|The trust certificate ("ADFS ProxyTrust - <WAP machine name>") is not valid|This could be caused by any of the following:<p>-   The Application Proxy machine was down for too long.<br />-   Disconnections between the Web Application Proxy and AD FS<br />-   Certificate infrastructure issues<br />-   Changes on the AD FS machine, or the renew process between the Web Application Proxy and the AD FS did not run as planned every 8 hours, then they need to renew trust<br />-   The clock of the Web Application Proxy machine and the AD FS are not synchronized.|Make sure the clocks are synchronized. Run the Install-WebApplicationProxy cmdlet.|
|Configuration data was not found in AD FS|This may be because Web Application Proxy was not fully installed yet or because of changes in the AD FS database or corruption of the database.|Run the Install-WebApplicationProxy Cmdlet|
|An error occurred when Web Application Proxy tried to read configuration from AD FS.|This may indicate that AD FS is not reachable, or that AD FS encountered an internal problem trying to read configuration from the AD FS database.|Verify that AD FS is reachable and working properly.|
|The configuration data stored in AD FS is corrupted or Web Application Proxy was unable to parse it.<p>OR<p>Web Application Proxywas unable to retrieve the list of Relying Parties from AD FS.|This may occur if the configuration data was modified in AD FS.|Restart the Web Application Proxyservice. If the problem persists, run the Install-WebApplicationProxy Cmdlet.|

## Administrator Console Events
The following administrator console events are generally indicative of authentication errors, invalid tokes or expired cookies.

|Event or symptom|Possible cause|Resolution|
|--------------------|------------------|--------------|
|11005<p>Web Application Proxy could not create the cookie encryption key using the secret from the configuration.|The global configuration "AccessCookiesEncryptionKey" parameter was changed by the PowerShell command: Set-WebApplicationProxyConfiguration -RegenerateAccessCookiesEncryptionKey|No actions is required.

The following administrator console events are usually indicative of problems having to do with configuration such as provisioning, request that are not successful, backend servers that are unreachable and buffer overflows.

|Event or symptom|Possible cause|Resolution|
|--------------------|------------------|--------------|
|12019<p>Web Application Proxy could not create a listener for the following URL.|A possible cause for the event is that another service is listening to the same URL.|The admin must make sure that no one listens or binds to the same URLs. To check this, run the command: netsh http show urlacl. If this URL is used by another component running on the Web Application Proxy machine, either remove it, or use a different URL to publish the applications through Web Application Proxy.|
|12020<p>Web Application Proxy could not create a reservation for the following URL.|A possible cause for the event is that another service has a reservation on the same URL.|The admin must make sure that no one binds to the same URLs. To check this, run the command: netsh http show urlacl. If this URL is used by another component running on the Web Application Proxy machine, either remove it, or use a different URL to publish the applications through Web Application Proxy.|
|12021<p>Web Application Proxy could not bind the SSL server certificate. All other configuration settings were applied.|Unable to create and set a configuration record of SSL certificate data.|Make sure that the certificate thumbprints that are configured for Web Application Proxyapplications are installed on all the Web Application Proxy machines with a private key in the local computer store.|
|13001<p>The SSL server certificate presented to Web Application Proxy by the backend server is not valid; the certificate is not trusted.|One or more errors were found in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate sent by the server. This could indicate that the backend server provided an SSL that was not valid or that there is no trust between the Web Application Proxy and the backend server.|Validate a backend server SSL certificate. Make sure that the Web Application Proxy machine is configured with the right root CAs to trust the backend server certificate.|
|13006|When the error code is 0x80072ee7, the failurrre   is caused by the inability to resolve the backend server URL. Other error codes are described in [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa384110(v=vs.85)](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn280944(v=ws.11))|Check that the backend server URL is correct and that its name can be resolved correctly from the Web Application Proxy machine.|
|13007<p>The HTTP response from the backend server was not received within the expected interval.|The back end server request timed out or is slow or unresponsive.|Check the backend server configuration. If it's very slow, check the connectivity to the backend server and also consider changing the Web Application Proxy global configuration parameter cmdlet for InactiveTransactionsTimeoutSec.|
