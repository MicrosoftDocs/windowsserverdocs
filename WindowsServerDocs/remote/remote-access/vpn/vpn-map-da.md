# Always On VPN features and functionalities

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows 10

- [**Previous:** Always On VPN Deployment for Windows Server and Windows 10](always-on-vpn/deploy/always-on-vpn-deploy.md)
- [**Next:** Learn about the Always On VPN Enhancements](../vpn/always-on-vpn/always-on-vpn-enhancements.md)

In this topic, you learn about the features and functionalities of Always On VPN.  The following table is not an exhaustive list, however, it does include some of the most common features and functionalities used in remote access solutions.

> [!TIP]
> If you currently use DirectAccess, we recommend that you investigate the Always On VPN functionality carefully to determine if it addresses all of your remote access needs before migrating from DirectAccess to Always On VPN.

|                                  Compliance using Network Access Protection (NAP).                                  | The Always On VPN client can integrate with Azure conditional access to enforce MFA, device compliance, or a combination of both. When compliant with conditional access policies, Azure AD issues a short-lived (by default, 60 minutes) IPsec authentication certificate that the client can then use to authenticate to the VPN gateway. Device compliance takes advantage of Configuration Manager/Intune compliance policies, which can include the device health attestation state. At this time, Azure VPN conditional access provides the closest replacement to the existing NAP solution, although there is no form of remediation service or quarantine network capabilities.

Always On VPN is available in all Windows editions, and the platform features are available to third parties by way of UWP VPN plug-in support.<p><p>***Note:***<br>Device Tunnel can only be configured on domain-joined devices running Windows 10 Enterprise or Education version 1709 or later. There is no support for third-party control of the Device Tunnel.                                           |
|                                       Support for both IPv4 and IPv6.                                        |                                                                                                                                                                 With Always On VPN, users can access both IPv4 and IPv6 resources on the corporate network. The Always On VPN client uses a dual-stack approach that doesn't specifically depend on IPv6 or the need for the VPN gateway to provide NAT64 or DNS64 translation services.                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                                Support for two-factor or OTP authentication.                                 |                    The Always On VPN platform natively supports EAP, which allows for the use of diverse Microsoft and third-party EAP types as part of the authentication workflow. Always On VPN specifically supports smart card (both physical and virtual) and Windows Hello for Business certificates to satisfy two-factor authentication requirements. Also, Always On VPN supports OTP through MFA (not supported natively, only supported on third-party plugins) by way of EAP RADIUS integration.<p><p>Define using:<br>**VPNv2/ProfileName/NativeProfile/Authentication**                    |
|                                  Support for multiple domains and forests.                                   |                                   The Always On VPN platform has no dependency on Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) forests or domain topology (or associated functional/schema levels) because it doesn't require the VPN client to be domain joined to function. Group Policy is therefore not a dependency to define VPN profile settings because you do not use it during client configuration. Where Active Directory authorization integration is required, you can achieve it through RADIUS as part of the EAP authentication and authorization process.                                   |
|              Support for both split and force tunnel for internet/intranet traffic separation.               |                                                                                               You can configure Always On VPN to support both force tunnel (the default operating mode) and split tunnel natively. Always On VPN provides additional granularity for application-specific routing policies.<p><p>***Note:***<br>Force Tunnel is supported by User Tunnel only. No other VPN Tunnels can be active in parallel to a Force Tunnel User Tunnel.<p><p>Define using:<p> **VPNv2/ProfileName/NativeProfile/RoutingPolicyType**<br>**VPNv2/ProfileName/TrafficFilterList/App/RoutingPolicyType**                                                                                               |
|                                          Multiple protocol support.                                          |                                                                                                                                                                            Always On VPN can be configured to support SSTP natively if Secure Sockets Layer fallback from IKEv2 is required.<p><p>***Note:***<br>User Tunnel supports SSTP and IKEv2, and Device Tunnel supports IKEv2 only with no support for SSTP fallback.                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                       Connectivity Assistant to provide corporate connectivity status.                       |                                                                                                            Always On VPN is fully integrated with the native Network Connectivity Assistant and provides connectivity status from the View All Networks interface. With the advent of Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1703), VPN connection status and VPN connection control for User Tunnel are now available through the Network flyout (for the Windows built-in VPN client), as well.                                                                                                            |
| Name resolution of corporate resources using short-name, fully qualified domain name (FQDN), and DNS suffix. | Always On VPN can natively define one or more DNS suffixes as part of the VPN connection and IP address assignment process, including corporate resource name resolution for short names, FQDNs, or entire DNS namespaces. Always On VPN also supports the use of Name Resolution Policy Tables to provide namespace-specific resolution granularity.<p><p>***Note:***<br>Avoid the use of Global Suffixes as they interfere with shortname resolution when using Name Resolution Policy tables.<p><p>Define using:<br>**VPNv2/ProfileName/DnsSuffix**<br>**VPNv2/ProfileName/DomainNameInformationList** |
