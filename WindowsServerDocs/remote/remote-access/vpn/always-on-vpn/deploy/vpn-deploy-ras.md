# Step 3. Configure the Remote Access Server for Always On VPN

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10

- [**Previous:** Step 2. Configure the Server Infrastructure](vpn-deploy-server-infrastructure.md)
- [**Previous:** Step 4. Install and configure the Network Policy Server (NPS)](vpn-deploy-nps.md)

RRAS is designed to perform well as both a router and a remote access server because it supports a wide array of features. For the purposes of this deployment, you require only a small subset of these features: support for IKEv2 VPN connections and LAN routing.

IKEv2 is a VPN tunneling protocol described in Internet Engineering Task Force Request for Comments 7296. The primary advantage of IKEv2 is that it tolerates interruptions in the underlying network connection. For example, if the connection is temporarily lost or if a user moves a client computer from one network to another, IKEv2 automatically restores the VPN connection when the network connection is reestablished—all without user intervention.

Configure the RRAS server to support IKEv2 connections while disabling unused protocols, which reduces the server's security footprint. Additionally, configure the server to assign addresses to VPN clients from a static address pool. You can feasibly assign addresses from either a pool or a DHCP server; however, using a DHCP server adds complexity to the design and delivers minimal benefits.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>It is important to:
>- Install two Ethernet network adapters in the physical server. If you are installing the VPN server on a VM, you must create two External virtual switches, one for each physical network adapter; and then create two virtual network adapters for the VM, with each network adapter connected to one virtual switch.
>
>- Install the server on your perimeter network between your edge and internal firewalls, with one network adapter connected to the External Perimeter Network, and one network adapter connected to the Internal Perimeter Network.

>[!WARNING]
>Before you get started, make sure to enable IPv6 on the VPN server. Otherwise, a connection cannot be established and an error message displays.

## Install Remote Access as a RAS Gateway VPN Server

       For example, if the NetBIOS name of your NPS server is NPS1 and your domain name is corp.contoso.com, enter **NPS1.corp.contoso.com**.

    e. In **Shared secret**, select **Change**.

       The Change Secret dialog box opens.

    f. In **New secret**, enter a text string.

    g. In **Confirm new secret**, enter the same text string, then select **OK**.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >Save this text string. When you configure the NPS Server on your Organization/Corporate network, you will add this VPN Server as a RADIUS Client. During that configuration, you will use this same shared secret so that the NPS and VPN Servers can communicate.

12. In **Add RADIUS Server**, review the default settings for:

    - **Time-out**

    - **Initial score**

    - **Port**

13. If necessary, change the values to match the requirements for your environment and select **OK**.

    A NAS is a device that provides some level of access to a larger network. A NAS using a RADIUS infrastructure is also a RADIUS client, sending connection requests and accounting messages to a RADIUS server for authentication, authorization, and accounting.

14. Review the setting for **Accounting provider**:

    |                    If you want the...                     |                                                     Then…                                                      |
