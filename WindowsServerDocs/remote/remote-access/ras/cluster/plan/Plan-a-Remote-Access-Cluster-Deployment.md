# Plan a Remote Access Cluster Deployment

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

 Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 combine DirectAccess and Remote Access Service (RAS) VPN into a single Remote Access role. This overview provides an introduction to the planning steps required in order to deploy a cluster of  Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2012 Remote Access servers.
  
-   [Plan an Advanced DirectAccess Deployment](../../../directaccess/single-server-advanced/Plan-an-Advanced-DirectAccess-Deployment.md). This step includes planning for the infrastructure required to deploy a single server. It includes planning for network and server settings, certificate requirements, DNS settings, network location server deployment, DirectAccess management servers, Active Directory settings, and Group Policy Objects (GPOs).  
  
-   [Step 2 Plan Cluster Servers](Step-2-Plan-Cluster-Servers.md) .  
  
-   [Step 3 Plan a Load-Balanced Cluster Deployment](Step-3-Plan-a-Load-Balanced-Cluster-Deployment.md).  
  
-   Step 4: Record your planning decisions for Remote Access advanced deployment. This record can be used as a job aid for everyone involved in completing the deployment steps.  
  
After you have completed these planning steps, see [Configure a Remote Access cluster](../configure/Configure-a-Remote-Access-Cluster.md). 

For instructions on configuring a cluster deployment as a proof of concept in a lab environment, see [Test Lab Guide - Demonstrate DirectAccess in a Cluster with Windows NLB](../../../directaccess/tlg-cluster-nlb/Test-Lab-Guide-Demonstrate-DirectAccess-in-a-Cluster-with-Windows-NLB.md).
