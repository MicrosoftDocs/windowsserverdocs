# Step 3 Configure a Load-Balanced Cluster

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

After preparing servers for the cluster, configure load-balancing on the single server, configure the required certificates, and deploy the cluster.

|Task|Description|
|----|--------|
|[3.1 Configure the IPv6 prefix](#BKMK_Prefix)|If the corporate environment is IPv4+IPv6, or IPv6-only, then on the single Remote Access server, ensure that the IPv6 prefix assigned to DirectAccess client computers is large enough to cover all of the servers in your cluster.|
|[3.2 Enable load balancing](#BKMK_NLB)|Enable load balancing on the single Remote Access server.|
|[3.3 Install the IP-HTTPS certificate](#BKMK_InstallIPHTTP)|Each server in the cluster requires a server certificate to authenticate IP-HTTPS connection.  Export the IP-HTTPS certificate from the single Remote Access server and deploy it on each server you will add to the cluster. This is required only if using non-self-signed certificates.|
|[3.4 Install the network location server certificate](#BKMK_NLS)|If the single server has the network location server deployed locally, then you will need to deploy the network location server certificate on each server in the cluster. If the network location server is hosted on an external server, a certificate on each server is not required. This is required only if using non-self-signed certificates.|
|[3.5 Add servers to the cluster](#BKMK_Add)|Add all servers to the cluster. Remote Access must not be configured on the servers to be added.|
|[3.6 Remove a server from the cluster](#BKMK_remove)|Instructions for removing a server from the cluster.|
|[3.7 Disable load balancing](#BKBK_disable)|Instructions for disabling load balancing.|

> [!NOTE]
> The IP address that is selected for the DIP must not be in use on the network adapters of the first Remote Access server in the cluster. Beginning the DirectAccess deployment with both VIP and DIP added to the network adapter will result in failure.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure not to use a DIP that is already present on another machine on the network.

## <a name="BKMK_Prefix"></a>3.1 Configure the IPv6 prefix

### <a name="configDA"></a>To configure the prefix

1.  On the Remote Access server, click **Start**, and then click **Remote Access Management**. If the **User Account Control** dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click **Yes**.

2.  In the Remote Access Management Console, click **Configuration**.

3.  In the middle pane of the console, in the **Step 2 DirectAccess Server** area, click **Edit**.

4.  Click **Prefix Configuration**. On the **Prefix Configuration** page, in **IPv6 prefix assigned to DirectAccess client computers**, enter the IPv6 prefix used for DirectAccess client computers with a subnet length of 59, for example, **2001:db8:1:1000::/59**. If VPN were also enabled with IPv6, then an IPv6 prefix would be displayed, and the subnet length would need to be changed to 59. Click **Next**.

5.  In the middle pane of the console, click **Finish**.

6.  On the **Remote Access Review** dialog box, review the configuration settings, and then click **Apply**. On the **Applying Remote Access Setup Wizard Settings** dialog box, click **Close**.

#### To enable load balancing

1.  On the configured DirectAccess server, click **Start**, and then click **Remote Access Management**. If the **User Account Control** dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click **Yes**.

2.  In the Remote Access Management console, in the left pane, click **Configuration**, and then in the **Tasks** pane, click **Enable Load Balancing**.

3.  In the Enable Load Balancing Wizard, click **Next**.

4.  Depending on what you chose in planning steps:

    1.  Windows NLB: On the **Load Balancing Method** page, click **Use Windows Network Load Balancing (NLB)**, and then click **Next**.

    2.  External load balancer: On the **Load Balancing Method** page, click **Use an external load balancer**, and then click **Next**.

5.  In a single network adapter deployment, on the **Dedicated IP Addresses** page, do the following, and then click **Next**:

    1.  In the **IPv4 address** box, enter the new IPv4 address for this Remote Access server; the current IPv4 address will be the virtual IP address (VIP) of the load-balanced cluster. In the **Subnet mask** box, enter the subnet mask.

    2.  If the corporate environment is native IPv6, then in the **IPv6 address** box, enter the new IPv6 address for this Remote Access server; the current IPv6 address will be the VIP of the load-balanced cluster. In the **Subnet prefix length** box, enter the subnet prefix length.

6.  In a two network adapter deployment, on the **External Dedicated IP Addresses** page, do the following, and then click **Next**:

    1.  In the **IPv4 address** box, enter the new external IPv4 address for this Remote Access server; the current IPv4 address will be the virtual IP address (VIP) of the load balancing cluster. In the **Subnet mask** box, enter the subnet mask.

    2.  If there are currently native IPv6 addresses configured on the internet-facing network adapter of the Remote Access server, in the **IPv6 address** box, enter the new external IPv6 address for this Remote Access server; the current IPv6 address will be the VIP of the load balancing cluster. In the **Subnet prefix length** box, enter the subnet prefix length.

7.  In a two network adapter deployment, on the **Internal Dedicated IP Addresses** page, do the following, and then click **Next**:

    1.  In the **IPv4 address** box, enter the new internal IPv4 address for this Remote Access server; the current IPv4 address will be the VIP of the load balancing cluster. In the **Subnet mask** box, enter the subnet mask.

    2.  If the corporate environment is native IPv6, then in the **IPv6 address** box, enter the new internal IPv6 address for this Remote Access server; the current IPv6 address will be the VIP of the load balancing cluster. In the **Subnet prefix length** box, enter the subnet prefix length.

8.  On the **Summary** page, click **Commit**.

9. On the **Enable Load Balancing** dialog box, click **Close**.

10. In the Enable Load Balancing Wizard, click **Close**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If external load balancing is being used, note the Virtual IPs and provide them as on the external load balancers.

![Windows PowerShell](../../../../media/Step-3-Configure-a-Load-Balanced-Cluster/PowerShellLogoSmall.gif)***<em>Windows PowerShell equivalent commands</em>***

The following Windows PowerShell cmdlet or cmdlets perform the same function as the preceding procedure. Enter each cmdlet on a single line, even though they may appear word-wrapped across several lines here because of formatting constraints.

If you chose to use Windows NLB in the planning steps, then execute the following:

```
Set-RemoteAccessLoadBalancer -InternetDedicatedIPAddress "2.1.1.20/255.255.255.0" -InternalDedicatedIPAddress @("10.1.1.30/255.255.255.0","3ffe::20/64") -InternetVirtualIPAddress @("2.1.1.1/255.255.255.0","2.1.1.2/255.255.255.0") -InternalVirtualIPAddress @("10.1.1.2/255.255.255.0","3ffe::2/64")
```

If you chose to use an external load balancer in the planning steps: then execute the following:

```
Set-RemoteAccessLoadBalancer -InternetDedicatedIPAddress "2.1.1.20/255.255.255.0" -InternalDedicatedIPAddress @("10.1.1.30/255.255.255.0","3ffe::20/64") -UseThirdPrtyLoadBalancer
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to not include changes to load-balancer settings with changes to any other settings, if you are using staging GPOs. Any changes to load-balancer settings must be applied first and then other configuration changes should be made. Also, after configuring load-balancer on a new DirectAccess server, please allow some time for the IP changes to be applied and replicated across the DNS servers in the enterprise, before you change other DirectAccess settings related to the new cluster.

```

## <a name="BKBK_disable"></a>3.7 Disable load balancing
[Do this step using Windows PowerShell](assetId:///7a817ca0-2b4a-4476-9d28-9a63ff2453f9)

#### To disable load balancing

1.  On the configured DirectAccess server, click **Start**, and then click **Remote Access Management**. If the **User Account Control** dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click **Yes**.

2.  In the Remote Access Management Console, click **Configuration**. In the **Tasks** pane, under **Load Balanced Cluster**, click **Disable Load Balancing**.

3.  On the **Disable Load Balancing** dialog box, click **Ok**.

4.  On the **Disable Load Balancing** dialog box, click **Close**.

![Windows PowerShell](../../../../media/Step-3-Configure-a-Load-Balanced-Cluster/PowerShellLogoSmall.gif)***<em>Windows PowerShell equivalent commands</em>***

The following Windows PowerShell cmdlet or cmdlets perform the same function as the preceding procedure. Enter each cmdlet on a single line, even though they may appear word-wrapped across several lines here because of formatting constraints.

```
set-RemoteAccessLoadBalancer -disable
```

Disabling load balancing will remove Remote Access settings and NLB settings (if configured) from all servers except the server from which it is being executed. On this Remote Access server, NLB settings will be removed (if it was configured) but Remote Access settings will remain.

Clicking **Remove configuration settings** will remove Remote Access and NLB (if configured) from all servers in the deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> -   If Remote Access is uninstalled when load balancing is deployed, all the servers are left with DIPs. The VIPs are removed. This causes all routes in the corporate network that are targeted to the VIPs addresses to fail. This also affects DNS entries which were resolved to the VIPs, such as the network location server certificate subject name. To avoid this issue, disable load balancing, which leaves the VIPs on the last Remote Access server, and then uninstall Remote Access.
> -   After using the **Set-RemoteAccessLoadBalancer** cmdlet to disable load balancing, wait for 2 minutes before running any other cmdlet. This should also be done in any scripts that run another cmdlet after the **Set-RemoteAccessLoadBalancer -disable** cmdlet.
> -   Disabling load balancing changes the virtual IP address of the cluster into a dedicated IP address. As a result, any operation that queries for the name of the server will fail until the cached DNS entry on the server expires. Make sure that you do not run any Remote Access PowerShell cmdlets after disabling load balancing until the cache on the server has expired. This problem is more common if you try to disable load balancing on a machine from another machine that is in another domain. This also occurs if you disable load balancing from the Remote Access Management console and may prevent the configuration from loading. The configuration will load after the cache has expired or has been flushed.
