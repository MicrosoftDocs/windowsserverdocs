# Remote Access Server Role Documentation

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

Remote Access Server Role documentation provides instructions to deploy any of the three role services (Always On VPN, Routing and Remote Access Service, Web Application Proxy) individually or on the same server. For example, these documents apply to situations where you have deployed any combination of the three role services, such as deploying both RRAS and DirectAccess on the same server.
