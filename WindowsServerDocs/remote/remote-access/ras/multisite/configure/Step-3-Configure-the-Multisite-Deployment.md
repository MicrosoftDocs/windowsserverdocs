```

## <a name="BKMK_Admin"></a>3.2. Grant administrator access

#### To grant administrator permissions

1.  On the Remote Access server in the additional entry point: On the **Start** screen, type **Computer Management**, and then press ENTER.

2.  In the left pane, click **Local Users and Groups**.

3.  Double-click **Groups**, and then double-click **Administrators**.

4.  On the **Administrators Properties** dialog box, click **Add**, and on the **Select Users, Computers, Service Accounts, or Groups** dialog box, click **Locations**.

5.  On the **Locations** dialog box, in the **Location** tree, click the location that contains the user account of the DirectAccess administrator, and then click **OK**.

6.  In the **Enter the object names to select**, enter the user name of the DirectAccess administrator, and then click **OK** twice.

7.  On the **Administrators Properties** dialog box, click **OK**.

8.  Close the Computer Management window.

9. Repeat this procedure on all Remote Access servers that will be part of the multisite deployment.

## <a name="BKMK_IPHTTPS"></a>3.3. Configure IP-HTTPS for a multisite deployment
On each Remote Access server that will be added to the multisite deployment, an SSL certificate is required to verify the HTTPS connection to the IP-HTTPS web server. Membership in the local **Administrators** group, or equivalent, is the minimum required to complete this procedure.

#### To obtain an IP-HTTPS certificate

1.  On each Remote Access server: On the **Start** screen, type **mmc**, and then press ENTER. If the **User Account Control** dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click **Yes**.

2.  Click **File**, and then click **Add/Remove Snap-ins**.

3.  Click **Certificates**, click **Add**, click **Computer account**, click **Next**, select **Local computer**, click **Finish**, and then click **OK**.

4.  In the console tree of the Certificates snap-in, open **Certificates (Local Computer)\Personal\Certificates**.

5.  Right-click **Certificates**, point to **All Tasks**, and then click **Request New Certificate**.

6.  Click **Next** twice.

7.  On the **Request Certificates** page, click the Web Server certificate template, and then click **More information is required to enroll for this certificate**.

    If the Web Server certificate template does not appear, ensure that the Remote Access server computer account has enroll permissions for the Web Server certificate template. For more information, see [Configure Permissions on the Web Server Certificate Template](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/ee649249(v=ws.10)).

8.  On the **Subject** tab of the **Certificate Properties** dialog box, in **Subject name**, for **Type**, select **Common name**.

9. In **Value**, type the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Internet name of the Remote Access server (for example, Europe.contoso.com), and then click **Add**.

10. Click **OK**, click **Enroll**, and then click **Finish**.

11. In the details pane of the Certificates snap-in, verify that a new certificate with the FQDN was enrolled with **Intended Purposes** of **Server Authentication**.

12. Right-click the certificate, and then click **Properties**.

13. In **Friendly Name**, type **IP-HTTPS Certificate**, and then click **OK**.

    > [!TIP]
    > Steps 12 and 13 are optional, but make it easier for you to select the certificate for IP-HTTPS when configuring Remote Access.

14. Repeat this procedure on all Remote Access servers in your deployment.

## <a name="BKMK_NLS"></a>3.4. Configure the network location server for a multisite deployment
If you selected to set up the network location server website on the Remote Access server when you set up your first server, each new Remote Access server that you add needs to be configured with a Web Server certificate that has the same subject name that was selected for the network location server for the first server. Each server requires a certificate to authenticate the connection to the network location server, and client computers located in the internal network must be able to resolve the name of the website in DNS.

#### To install a certificate for network location

1.  On the Remote Access server: On the **Start** screen, type **mmc**, and then press ENTER. If the **User Account Control** dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click **Yes**.

2.  Click **File**, and then click **Add/Remove Snap-ins**.

3.  Click **Certificates**, click **Add**, click **Computer account**, click **Next**, select **Local computer**, click **Finish**, and then click **OK**.

4.  In the console tree of the Certificates snap-in, open **Certificates (Local Computer)\Personal\Certificates**.

5.  Right-click **Certificates**, point to **All Tasks**, and then click **Request New Certificate**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may also import the same certificate that was used for the network location server for the first Remote Access server.

6.  Click **Next** twice.

7.  On the **Request Certificates** page, click the Web Server certificate template, and then click **More information is required to enroll for this certificate**.

    If the Web Server certificate template does not appear, ensure that the Remote Access server computer account has enroll permissions for the Web Server certificate template. For more information, see [Configure Permissions on the Web Server Certificate Template](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/ee649249(v=ws.10)).

8.  On the **Subject** tab of the **Certificate Properties** dialog box, in **Subject name**, for **Type**, select **Common name**.

9. In **Value**, type the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that was configured for the network location server certificate of the first Remote Access server (for example, nls.corp.contoso.com), and then click **Add**.

10. Click **OK**, click **Enroll**, and then click **Finish**.

11. In the details pane of the Certificates snap-in, verify that a new certificate with the FQDN was enrolled with **Intended Purposes** of **Server Authentication**.

12. Right-click the certificate, and then click **Properties**.

13. In **Friendly Name**, type **Network Location Certificate**, and then click **OK**.

    > [!TIP]
    > Steps 12 and 13 are optional, but make it easier for you to select the certificate for network location when configuring Remote Access.

14. Repeat this procedure on all Remote Access servers in your deployment.

### <a name="NLS"></a>To create the network location server DNS records

1.  On the DNS server: On the **Start** screen, type **dnsmgmt.msc**, and then press ENTER.

2.  In the left pane of the **DNS Manager** console, open the forward lookup zone for the internal network. Right click the relevant zone and click **New Host (A or AAAA)**.

3.  On the **New Host** dialog box, in the **Name (uses parent domain name if blank)** box, enter the name that was used for the network location server for the first Remote Access server. In the **IP address** box, enter the intranet-facing IPv4 address of the Remote Access server, and then click **Add Host**. On the **DNS** dialog box, click **OK**.

4.  On the **New Host** dialog box, in the **Name (uses parent domain name if blank)** box, enter the name that was used for the network location server for the first Remote Access server. In the **IP address** box, enter the intranet-facing IPv6 address of the Remote Access server, and then click **Add Host**. On the **DNS** dialog box, click **OK**.

5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 for every Remote Access server in your deployment.

6.  Click **Done**.

7.  Repeat this procedure before adding servers as additional entry points in the deployment.

## <a name="BKMK_Client"></a>3.5. Configure DirectAccess clients for a multisite deployment
DirectAccess Windows client computers must be members of security group(s) which define their DirectAccess association. Before multisite is enabled, these security group(s) can contain both Windows 8 clients and  Windows 7  clients (if the appropriate "downlevel" mode was selected). Once multisite is enabled, existing client security group(s), in single server mode, are converted to security group(s) for Windows 8 only. After multisite is enabled, DirectAccess  Windows 7  client computers must be moved to corresponding dedicated  Windows 7  client security groups (which are associated with specific entry-points), or they will not be able to connect over DirectAccess. The  Windows 7  clients must first be removed from the existing security groups which are now Windows 8 security groups. Caution:  Windows 7  client computers that are members of both  Windows 7  and Windows 8 client security groups will lose remote connectivity, and  Windows 7  clients without SP1 installed will lose corporate connectivity as well. Therefore, all  Windows 7  client computers must be removed from Windows 8 security groups.

#### Remove  Windows 7  clients from Windows 8 security groups

1.  On the primary domain controller, click **Start**, and then click **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

2.  To remove computers from the security group, double-click the security group, and on the **<Group_Name> Properties** dialog box, click the **Members** tab.

3.  Select the  Windows 7  client computer, and click **Remove**.

4.  Repeat this procedure to remove the  Windows 7  client computers from the Windows 8 security groups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When enabling a Remote Access multisite configuration all client computers ( Windows 7  and Windows 8) will lose remote connectivity until they are able to connect to the corporate network directly or by VPN to update their group policies. This is true when enabling multisite functionality for the first time, and also when disabling multisite.

## <a name="BKMK_Enable"></a>3.6. Enable the multisite deployment
To configure a multisite deployment, enable the multisite feature on your existing Remote Access server. Before enabling multisite in your deployment, make sure you have the following information:

1.  Global load balancer settings and IP addresses if you want to load balance DirectAccess client connections across all entry-points in your deployment.

2.  The security group(s) containing  Windows 7  client computers for the first entry point in your deployment, if you want to enable Remote Access for  Windows 7  client computers.

3.  Group Policy Object names, if you are required to use non-default Group Policy Objects, which are applied on  Windows 7  client computers for the first entry point in your deployment, if you require support for  Windows 7  client computers.

### <a name="EnabledMultisite"></a>To enable a multisite configuration

1.  On your existing Remote Access server: On the **Start** screen, type **RAMgmtUI.exe**, and then press ENTER. If the **User Account Control** dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click **Yes**.

2.  In the Remote Access Management Console, click **Configuration**, and then in the **Tasks** pane, click **Enable Multisite**.

    -   Click **Assign entry points automatically, and allow clients to select manually** to automatically route client computers to the most suitable entry point, while also allowing client computers to select an entry point manually. Manual entry point selection is available only for Windows 8 computers. Click **Next**.

    -   Click **Assign entry points automatically** to automatically route client computers to the most suitable entry point, and then click **Next**.

6.  On the **Global Load Balancing** page, do one of the following:

    -   Click **No, do not use global load balancing** if you do not want to use a global load balancing, and then click **Next**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > When selecting this option client computers connect to their closest entry point automatically.

    -   Click **Yes, use global load balancing** if you want to load balance the traffic globally between all entry points. In **Type the global load balancing FQDN to be used by all entry points**, enter the global load balancing FQDN, and in **Type the global load balancing IP address for this entry point** that contains the first Remote Access server, enter the global load balancing IP address for this entry point, and then click **Next**.

7.  On the **Client Support** page, do one of the following:

    -   To limit access to client computers running Windows 8 or later operating systems, click **Limit access to client computers running Windows 8 or a later operating system**, and then click **Next**.

    -   To allow client computers running  Windows 7  to access this entry point, click **Allow client computers running Windows 7 to access this entry point**, and click **Add**. On the **Select Groups** dialog box, select the security group(s) that contains the  Windows 7  client computers, click **OK**, and then click **Next**.

8.  On the **Client GPO Settings** page, accept the default GPO for  Windows 7  client computers for this entry point, type the name of the GPO that want Remote Access to create automatically, or click **Browse** to locate the GPO for  Windows 7  client computers, and then click **Next**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > -   The **Client GPO Settings** page appears only when you configure the entry point to allow  Windows 7  client computers to access the entry point.
    > -   You can optionally click **Validate GPOs** to ensure that you have the proper permissions for the selected GPO or GPOs for this entry point. If the GPO does not exist and will be automatically created, then create and link permissions are required. In the case where the GPOs were created manually, then edit, modify security, and delete permissions are required.

9. On the **Summary** page, click **Commit**.

10. On the **Enabling Multisite Deployment** dialog box, click **Close** and then on the Enable Multisite Deployment wizard, click **Close**.

![Windows PowerShell](../../../../media/Step-3-Configure-the-Multisite-Deployment/PowerShellLogoSmall.gif)***<em>Windows PowerShell equivalent commands</em>***

The following Windows PowerShell cmdlet or cmdlets perform the same function as the preceding procedure. Enter each cmdlet on a single line, even though they may appear word-wrapped across several lines here because of formatting constraints.

To enable a multisite deployment named 'Contoso' on the first entry point named 'Edge1-US'. The deployment allows clients to manually select the entry point, and does not use a global load balancer.

```
Enable-DAMultiSite -Name 'Contoso' -EntryPointName 'Edge1-US' -ManualEntryPointSelectionAllowed 'Enabled'
```

To allow  Windows 7  client computers access through the first entry point through the security group DA_Clients_US and using the GPO DA_W7_Clients_GPO_US.
