# Step 4 Plan for OTP on the Remote Access Server

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

After planning for the one-time password (OTP) RADIUS server and certificate settings, the final step in planning a Remote Access OTP deployment is to plan for client OTP settings on the Remote Access server.

|Task|Description|
|----|--------|
|[4.1 Plan for OTP client exemptions](#bkmk_4_1_Exemptions)|Plan for exemptions for users that you do not require to authentication using OTP.|
|[4.2 Plan for Windows 7 clients](#bkmk_4_2_Win7)|Plan to deploy the DirectAccess Connectivity Assistant (DCA) 2.0 to  Windows 7  client computers.|
|[4.3 Plan for smart cards](#BKMK_smartcard)|Plan for the use of smart cards for additional authorization.|

## <a name="bkmk_4_1_Exemptions"></a>4.1 Plan for OTP client exemptions
When OTP authentication is enabled, by default all users are required to authenticate using a combination of user name and password, and OTP credentials. However, you can allow selected users to authenticate using a user name and password only, without OTP. To do this, create a security group and add any users that you want to exempt from OTP authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> Only client computers from a single forest may be exempted due to the fact that only one security group can be selected for client exemptions.

## <a name="bkmk_4_2_Win7"></a>4.2 Plan for Windows 7 clients
By default,  Windows 7  client computers cannot authenticate using OTP.  Windows 7  client computers require DCA 2.0 to authenticate using OTP in a  Windows Server 2012  Remote Access deployment. For more information about DCA 2.0, see [DirectAccess Connectivity Assistant 2.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=253699) on the Microsoft Download Center.

## <a name="BKMK_smartcard"></a>4.3 Plan for smart cards
When OTP authentication is enabled, the option to enable the use of smart cards for additional authorization is available. Create a security group to allow temporary access in the event that a user's smart card is not functional.
