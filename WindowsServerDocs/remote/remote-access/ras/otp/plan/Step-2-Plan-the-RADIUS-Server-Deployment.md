# Step 2 Plan the RADIUS Server Deployment

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

After deploying a single Remote Access server, plan for the one-time password (OTP) authentication server.

|Task|Description|
|----|--------|
|2.1 Plan the RADIUS server|For the OTP authentication server, Remote Access in  Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 supports any RADIUS-enabled OTP server that supports the password authentication protocol (PAP).|

## <a name="BKMK_1.1"></a>2.1 Plan the RADIUS server
Note the following when planning a RADIUS server for OTP authentication:

-   For most types of OTP deployments, you must configure the Remote Access server as a RADIUS agent. For more information, see the OTP vendor documentation.

-   For all OTP deployments, you must synchronize your Active Directory users with your RADIUS server.

-   The RADIUS server does not need to be a domain member.

-   When you deploy the RADIUS server, you configure a shared secret and the port number for RADIUS traffic. Make a note of these details; they are required when you configure the Remote Access server.

You can view an example test lab guide that sets up OTP authentication with an RSA SecurID server in [Test Lab Guide: Demonstrate DirectAccess with OTP authentication and RSA SecurID](../../../directaccess/tlg-otp-securid/test-lab-guide-demonstrate-directaccess-with-otp-authentication-and-rsa-securid.md).
