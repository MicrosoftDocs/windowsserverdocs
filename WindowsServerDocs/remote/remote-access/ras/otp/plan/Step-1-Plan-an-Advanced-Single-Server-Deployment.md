# Step 1 Plan an Advanced Single Server Deployment

>Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

The first step in planning a Remote Access with one-time password (OTP) client authentication deployment is to plan and configure an advanced single server deployment.

## Plan a single server deployment
Before you deploy Remote Access with OTP, make sure that you have completed all the steps to deploy a single Remote Access server. See [Deploy a Single DirectAccess Server with Advanced Settings](../../../directaccess/single-server-advanced/deploy-a-single-directaccess-server-with-advanced-settings.md).
