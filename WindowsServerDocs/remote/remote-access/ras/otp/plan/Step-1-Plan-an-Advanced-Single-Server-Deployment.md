# Step 1 Plan an Advanced Single Server Deployment

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

The first step in planning a Remote Access with one-time password (OTP) client authentication deployment is to plan and configure an advanced single server deployment.  
  
## Plan a single server deployment  
Before you deploy Remote Access with OTP, make sure that you have completed all the steps to deploy a single Remote Access server. See [Deploy a Single DirectAccess Server with Advanced Settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/networking/remote-access/directaccess/single-server-advanced/deploy-a-single-directaccess-server-with-advanced-settings).
