# Step 1 Implement a Single Server Remote Access Deployment with OTP Authentication

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

The first configuration step to deploy Remote Access with OTP is to implement an advanced single server deployment and then plan to add the RADIUS server.

## Implement a single server deployment
Before you can configure Remote Access with OTP, you must configure an advanced single server Remote Access deployment as described in [Deploy a Single DirectAccess Server with Advanced Settings](../../../directaccess/single-server-advanced/deploy-a-single-directaccess-server-with-advanced-settings.md).
