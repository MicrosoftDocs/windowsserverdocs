# Monitor the operations status of the Remote Access server and its components

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

**Note:** Windows Server 2012 combines DirectAccess and Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) into a single Remote Access role.

The management console in the Remote Access server can be used to monitor its operations status.

#### To monitor the Remote Access server operations status

1.  In **Server Manager**, click **Tools**, and then click **Remote Access Management**.

2.  Click **DASHBOARD** to navigate to **Remote Access Reporting** in the **Remote Access Management Console**.

3.  On the monitoring dashboard, notice the **Operations Status** tile within the **Server Status** tile. This tile lists the server operations status and the status of all the server's components.

4.  Click **Refresh** under **Tasks** in the right pane to reload the operations status. The operations status is automatically refreshed every five minutes, which is the default refresh interval. To change the default refresh interval, click **Configure Refresh Interval**.
