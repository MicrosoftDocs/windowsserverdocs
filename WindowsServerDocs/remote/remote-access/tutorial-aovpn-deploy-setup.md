# Tutorial: Deploy Always On VPN infrastructure

Always On VPN is a remote access solution in Windows Server that provides seamless and secure connectivity for remote users to corporate networks. It supports advanced authentication methods and integrates with existing infrastructure, offering a modern alternative to traditional VPN solutions. This tutorial begins the series to deploy Always On VPN in a sample environment.

In this tutorial, you learn how to deploy a sample infrastructure for Always On VPN connections for remote domain-joined Windows client computers. To create a sample infrastructure, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create an Active Directory domain controller.
> - Configure Group Policy for autoenrollment of certificates.
> - Create a Network Policy Server (NPS) server.
> - Create a VPN server.
> - Create a VPN user and group.
> - Configure the VPN server as a RADIUS client.
> - Configure the NPS server as a RADIUS server.

To learn more about Always On VPN, including supported integrations, security and connectivity features, see [Always On VPN Overview](overview-always-on-vpn.md).

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this tutorial, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- Three servers (physical or virtual) running a supported version Windows Server. These servers are the domain controller, NPS server, and VPN server.

- The server you use for the NPS server needs two physical network adapters installed: one to connect to the internet, and one to connect to the network where the domain controller is located.

- A user account on all machines that is a member of the local **Administrators** security group, or equivalent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using Remote Access in Microsoft Azure isn't supported. For more information, see [Microsoft server software support for Microsoft Azure virtual machines](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2721672/microsoft-server-software-support-for-microsoft-azure-virtual-machines).

## Create the domain controller

1. On the server you want to be the domain controller, install [Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview). For detailed information on how to install AD DS, see [Install Active Directory Domain Services](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/deploy/install-active-directory-domain-services--level-100-#to-install-ad-ds-by-using-server-manager).

1. Promote the Windows Server to domain controller. For this tutorial, you create a new forest and the domain to that new forest. For detailed information on how to install the domain controller, see [AD DS Installation](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/deploy/ad-ds-installation-and-removal-wizard-page-descriptions#dns-options).

1. Install and configure the Certificate Authority (CA) on the domain controller. For detailed information on how to install the CA, see [Install the Certification Authority](/windows-server/networking/core-network-guide/cncg/server-certs/install-the-certification-authority).

## Configure Group Policy for autoenrollment of certificates

In this section, you create a Group Policy on the domain controller so that domain members automatically request user and computer certificates. This configuration enables VPN users to request and retrieve user certificates that automatically authenticate VPN connections. This policy also allows the NPS server to request server authentication certificates automatically.

1. On the domain controller, open the Group Policy Management console.

1. In the left pane, right-click your domain (for example, `corp.contoso.com`). Select **Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here**.

1. On the **New GPO** dialog box, for **Name**, enter *Autoenrollment Policy*. Select **OK**.

1. In the left pane, right-click **Autoenrollment Policy**. Select **Edit** to open the **Group Policy Management Editor**.

1. In **Group Policy Management Editor**, complete the following steps to configure computer certificate autoenrollment:

   1. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Public Key Policies**.

   1. In the details pane, right-click **Certificate Services Client – Auto-Enrollment**. Select **Properties**.

   1. On the **Certificate Services Client – Auto-Enrollment Properties** dialog box, for **Configuration Model**, select **Enabled**.

   1. Select **Renew expired certificates, update pending certificates, and remove revoked certificates** and **Update certificates that use certificate templates**.

   1. Select **OK**.

1. In **Group Policy Management Editor**, complete the following steps to configure user certificate autoenrollment:

   1. Navigate to **User Configuration** > **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Public Key Policies**.

   1. In the details pane, right-click **Certificate Services Client – Auto-Enrollment** and select **Properties**.

   1. On the **Certificate Services Client – Auto-Enrollment Properties** dialog box, in **Configuration Model**, select **Enabled**.

   1. Select **Renew expired certificates, update pending certificates, and remove revoked certificates** and **Update certificates that use certificate templates**.

   1. Select **OK**.

   1. Close Group Policy Management Editor.

1. Apply the Group Policy to users and computers in the domain.

1. Close the Group Policy Management console.

## Create the NPS server

1. On the server you want to be the NPS server, install the [Network Policy and Access Services (NPS) role](/windows-server/networking/technologies/nps/nps-top). For detailed information on how to install NPS, see [Install Network Policy Server](/windows-server/networking/technologies/nps/nps-manage-install).

1. Register the NPS Server in Active Directory. For information on how to register NPS Server in Active Directory, see [Register an NPS in an Active Directory Domain](/windows-server/networking/technologies/nps/nps-manage-register).

1. Make sure that your firewalls allow the traffic that is necessary for both VPN and RADIUS communications to function correctly. For more information, see [Configure Firewalls for RADIUS Traffic](../../networking/technologies/nps/nps-firewalls-configure.md).

1. Create the NPS Servers group:

   1. On the domain controller, open Active Directory Users and Computers.

   1. Under your domain, right-click **Computers**. Select **New**, then select **Group**.

   1. In **Group name**, enter **NPS Servers**, then select **OK**.

   1. Right-click **NPS Servers** and select **Properties**.

   1. On the **Members** tab of the NPS Servers Properties dialog box, select **Add**.

   1. Select **Object Types**, select the **Computers** check box, then select **OK**.

   1. In **Enter the object names to select**, enter the hostname of the NPS server. Select **OK**.

   1. Close Active Directory Users and Computers.

## Create the VPN server

1. For the server that runs the VPN server, ensure that the machine has two physical network adapters installed: one to connect to the internet, and one to connect to the network where the domain controller is located.

1. Identify which network adapter connects to the internet and which network adapter connects to the domain. Configure the network adapter facing the internet with a public IP address, while the adapter facing the intranet can use an IP address from the local network.

1. For the network adapter connecting to the domain, set the DNS preferred IP address to the IP address of the domain controller.

1. Join the VPN server to the domain. For information on how to join a server to a domain, see [To join a server to a domain](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/join-a-computer-to-a-domain#to-join-a-server-to-a-domain).

1. Open your firewall rules to allow UDP ports 500 and 4500 inbound to the external IP address applied to the public interface on the VPN server. For the network adapter connecting to the domain, allow the following UDP ports: 1812, 1813, 1645, and 1646.

1. Create the VPN Servers group:

    1. On the domain controller, open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    1. Under your domain, right-click **Computers**. Select **New**, then select **Group**.

    1. In **Group name**, enter **VPN Servers**, then select **OK**.

    1. Right-click **VPN Servers** and select **Properties**.

    1. On the **Members** tab of the VPN Servers Properties dialog box, select **Add**.

    1. Select **Object Types**, select the **Computers** check box, then select **OK**.

    1. In **Enter the object names to select**, enter the hostname of the VPN server. Select **OK**.
