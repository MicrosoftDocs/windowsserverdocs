# Install Remote Access as a VPN server

In this getting started guide, we'll show you how to install and configure Remote Access (RAS) as a VPN server.

## Prerequisites

Membership in Administrators, or equivalent, is the minimum required to perform these procedures. However, if the RAS server is domain joined, then the procedures need to be performed by a domain administrator.

## Install the Remote Access role

## Configure Remote Access as a VPN server

In this section, we'll configure Remote Access to allow IKEv2 VPN connections and to deny connections from other VPN protocols. We'll also assign a static IP address pool for the issuance of IP addresses to connecting authorized VPN clients.

>[!NOTE]
>Instead of IKEv2, you can also choose to use SSTP. We don't recommend that you use PPTP, due to its lack of security features.

1. Make sure that your firewall rules allow UDP portsÂ 500 and 4500 inbound to the external IP address applied to the public interface on the VPN server.

1. On the VPN server, in Server Manager, select the Notifications flag. You may have to wait a minute or two to see the Notifications flag.

1. In the **Tasks** menu, select **Open the Getting Started Wizard** to open the Configure Remote Access wizard.

   >[!NOTE]
   >The Configure Remote Access wizard might open behind Server Manager. If you think the wizard is taking too long to open, move or minimize Server Manager to find out whether the wizard is behind it. If not, wait for the wizard to initialize.

1. Select *Deploy VPN only* to open the Routing and Remote Access Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

1. Right-click the VPN server, and then select *Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access* to open the Routing and Remote Access Server Setup Wizard.

    1. Select **Static address pool**.

    2. Select **Add** to configure an IP address pool.

    3. In **Start IP address**, enter the starting IP address in the range you want to assign to VPN clients.

1. Select **WAN Miniport (SSTP)** and select **Configure** to open the Configure Device - WAN Miniport (SSTP) dialog box.

    1. Clear both  **Remote access connections (inbound only)**  and **Demand-dial routing connections (inbound and outbound)**.

    2. Select **OK**.

1. Select **WAN Miniport (IKEv2)** and select **Configure** to open the Configure Device - WAN Miniport (IKEv2) dialog box.

    1. Ensure that the **Remote access connections (inbound only)** and  **Demand-dial routing connections (inbound and outbound)** are selected.

    1. In **Maximum ports**, enter the number of ports to match the maximum number of simultaneous VPN connections that you want to support.
