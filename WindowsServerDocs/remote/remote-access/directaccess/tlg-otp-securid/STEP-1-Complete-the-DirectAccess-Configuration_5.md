>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

The first step is to complete the [Test Lab Guide: Demonstrate DirectAccess Single Server Setup with Mixed IPv4 and IPv6](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=237004). If you have already completed the steps in that test lab guide and saved a snapshot or disk image of the test lab, you can restore the snapshot or image and begin with the next step.
