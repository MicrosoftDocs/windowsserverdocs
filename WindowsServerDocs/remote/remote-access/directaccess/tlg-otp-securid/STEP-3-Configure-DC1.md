# STEP 3 Configure DC1

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

DC1 acts as a domain controller, DNS server, and DHCP server for the corp.contoso.com domain. Configure DC1 as follows:

## Verify User1 has a User Principal Name defined on DC1

1.  On DC1, open Server Manager, and click **AD DS** in the left pane. Right-click **DC1** and select **Active Directory Users and Computers**. In the left pane expand **corp.contoso.com\Users**, and double-click User1.

2.  On the **Account** tab verify that **User logon name** is set to User1. If not, then enter **User1** in the **User logon name** field.

3.  Click **OK**. Close the **Active Directory Users and Computers** console.
