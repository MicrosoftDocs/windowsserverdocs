> [!WARNING]
> The design of this test lab guide includes infrastructure servers, such as a domain controller and a certification authority (CA) that are running either Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012. Using this test lab guide to configure infrastructure servers that are running other operating systems has not been tested, and instructions for configuring other operating systems are not included in this guide.

1.  Run **certtmpl.msc**, and then press ENTER.

Click **Add**, and on the **Add Application Policy** dialog box, click **New**, enter **DA OTP RA** in the **Name:** field and **1.3.6.1.4.1.311.81.1.1** in the **Object identifier:** field, and click **OK**. On the **Add Application Policy** dialog box, click **OK**. On the **Edit Application Policies Extension**, click **OK**. On the **Properties of New Template** dialog box, click **OK**.

## <a name="DAOTPLogon"></a>To create and deploy a certificate template for OTP certificates issued by the corporate CA

1.  In the Certificate Templates Console, in the details pane, right-click the **Smartcard Logon** template, and click **Duplicate Template**.

2.  On the **Properties of New Template** dialog box, on the **Compatibility** tab in the **Certification Authority** list, click the operating system you want to use, and in the **Resulting changes** dialog box, click **OK**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > **Windows Server 2003 CA**. In situations where the certification authority (CA) is on a computer that is running Windows Server 2003, then the certificate template must be configured on a different computer. This is required because setting the **Validity period** in hours is not possible when running Windows versions prior to  Windows Server 2008  and Windows Vista. If the computer that you use to configure the template does not have the Active Directory Certificate Services server role installed, or if it is a client computer, then you may need to install the Certificate Templates snap-in. For more information, see [Install the Certificate Templates Snap-In](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc732445(v=ws.11)).
    >
    > **Windows Server 2008 R2 CA**. If you have already deployed a certification authority (CA) that is running  Windows Server 2008 R2 , you must configure the certificate template **Renewal Period** to 1 or 2 hours, and the **Validity Period** to be longer than the **Renewal Period**, but not more than 4 hours. If you configure a certificate template **Validity Period** of longer than 4 hours with a CA that is running  Windows Server 2008 R2 , the DirectAccess installation wizard cannot detect the certificate template, and DirectAccess installation fails.

5.  Click the **Security** tab, select **Authenticated Users**, in the **Allow** column, and select the **Read** and **Enroll** check boxes. Click **OK**. Click **Domain Admins** and **Enterprise Admins**, and click **Full Control** under the **Allow** column for both. Click **Apply**.

6.  Click the **Subject Name** tab, and then click **Build from this Active Directory information**. In the **Subject name format:** list select **Fully distinguished name**, make sure that the **User principal name (UPN)** box is checked, and click **Apply**.

7.  Click the **Server** tab, select the **Do not store certificates and requests in the CA database** check box, clear the **Do not include revocation information in issued certificates** check box, and then on the **Properties of New Template** dialog box,  click **Apply**.

8.  Click the **Issuance Requirements** tab, select the **This number of authorized signatures:** check box, set the value to 1. In the **Policy type required in signature:** list select **Application policy**, and in the **Application policy** list select **DA OTP RA**. On the **Properties of New Template** dialog box, click **OK**.

9. Click the **Extensions** tab, and on **Application Policies** click **Edit**. Delete **Client Authentication**, keep **SmartCardLogon**, and click **OK** twice.

10. Close the Certificate Templates Console.

11. On the **Start** screen, type**certsrv.msc**, and then press ENTER.
