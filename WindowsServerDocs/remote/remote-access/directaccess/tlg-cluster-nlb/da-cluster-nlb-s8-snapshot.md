# STEP 8 Snapshot the DirectAccess Cluster-NLB Configuration

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

This completes the DirectAccess test lab. To save this configuration so that you can quickly return to a working DirectAccess with NLB cluster configuration from which you can test other DirectAccess modular test lab guides, test lab guide extensions, or for your own experimentation and learning, do the following:

1.  On all physical computers or virtual machines in the test lab, close all windows and then perform a graceful shutdown.

2.  If your lab is based on virtual machines, save a snapshot of each virtual machine and name the snapshots DirectAccess cluster and NLB. If your lab uses physical computers, create disk images to save the DirectAccess test lab configuration.
