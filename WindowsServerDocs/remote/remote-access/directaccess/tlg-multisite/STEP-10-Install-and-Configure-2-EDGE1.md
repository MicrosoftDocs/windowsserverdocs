# STEP 10 Install and Configure 2-EDGE1

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

2-EDGE1 configuration consists of the following:

- Install the operating system on 2-EDGE1. Install  Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012 on 2-EDGE1.

- Configure TCP/IP properties. Configure 2-EDGE1 with static addresses on both network interfaces.

- Configure routing between subnets. To enable communication between the Corpnet and 2-Corpnet subnets, you must configure routing.

- Join 2-EDGE1 to the CORP2 domain. Join 2-EDGE1 to the corp2.corp.contoso.com domain.

- Obtain certificates on 2-EDGE1. Certificates are required for the IPsec connection between DirectAccess clients and the Remote Access server, and to authenticate the IP-HTTPS listener when clients connect over HTTPS.

- Provide access to CORP\User1. The user CORP\User1 is the Remote Access administrator. To enable this user to make changes to 2-EDGE1 from EDGE1, you must grant access to the user.

- Install the Remote Access role on 2-EDGE1. To enable a multisite deployment, you must install the Remote Access role on 2-EDGE1.

2-EDGE1 must have two network adapters installed.
