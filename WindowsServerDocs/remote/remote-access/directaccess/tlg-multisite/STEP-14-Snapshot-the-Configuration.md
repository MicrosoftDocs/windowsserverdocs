# STEP 14 Snapshot the Configuration

>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

This completes the DirectAccess multisite test lab. To save this configuration so that you can quickly return to a working DirectAccess multisite configuration from which you can test other DirectAccess modular test lab guides, test lab guide extensions, or for your own experimentation and learning, do the following:

1.  On all physical computers or virtual machines in the test lab, close all windows and then perform a graceful shutdown.

2.  If your lab is based on virtual machines, save a snapshot of each virtual machine and name the snapshots TLG DirectAccess Multisite. If your lab uses physical computers, create disk images to save the DirectAccess test lab configuration.
