DirectAccess  allows connectivity for remote users to organization network resources without the need for traditional Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections. With DirectAccess connections, remote client computers are always connected to your organization - there is no need for remote users to start and stop connections, as is required with VPN connections. In addition, your IT administrators can manage DirectAccess client computers whenever they are running and Internet connected.  
  
DirectAccess provides support only for domain-joined clients that include operating system support for DirectAccess.
