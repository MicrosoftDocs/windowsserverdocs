# Step 3 Verify Deployments

This topic describes how to verify that you have correctly configured your basic DirectAccess deployment.

### To verify access to internal resources through DirectAccess

1.  Connect a DirectAccess client computer to the corporate network and obtain the group policy.

2.  Click the **Network connections** icon in the notification area to access the DA Media Manager.

3.  Click the **DirectAccess Connection**, and you will see that the status is **Connected Locally**.

4.  Connect the client computer to the external network and attempt to access internal resources.

    You should be able to access all corporate resources.
