>Applies To: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016

This topic lists the planning steps that are required to deploy a single DirectAccess server running  Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows Server 2012 with a full range of basic and advanced features. The planning phase includes the following topics.  
  
-   [Step 1: Plan the Advanced DirectAccess Infrastructure](da-adv-plan-s1-infrastructure.md)  
  
    In this phase, you plan your network and server topology, firewall settings, certificate requirements, the Domain Name System (DNS), Active Directory, DirectAccess management servers, and the DirectAccess network location server.  
  
-   [Step 2: Plan Advanced DirectAccess Deployments](da-adv-plan-s2-deployments.md)  
  
    In this phase, you plan for the client and server deployment, including the DirectAccess infrastructure and the application servers.  
  
## Next step  
After you have completed these planning steps, you can begin the server deployment. For instructions, see [Install and Configure Advanced DirectAccess](Install-and-Configure-Advanced-DirectAccess.md).
