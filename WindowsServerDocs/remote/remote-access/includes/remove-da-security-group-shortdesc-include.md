**Remove devices from the DirectAccess security group.** As users migrate successfully, you remove their devices from the DirectAccess security group. Before removing DirectAccess from your environment, check to see if the DirectAccess security group is empty. **Do not** remove the security group if it still contains members. If you do remove the security group with members in it, you risk leaving employees without remote access from their devices. Use Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager or Microsoft Intune to determine device-assignment information and discover which device belongs to each user.
