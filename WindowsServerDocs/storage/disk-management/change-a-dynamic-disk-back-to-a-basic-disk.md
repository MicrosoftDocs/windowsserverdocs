# Change a dynamic disk back to a basic disk

> **Applies To:** Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

This topic describes how to delete everything on a dynamic disk and then convert it back to a basic disk. Dynamic disks have been deprecated from Windows and we don't recommend using them anymore. Instead, we recommend using basic disks or using the newer [Storage Spaces](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12438/windows-10-storage-spaces) technology when you want to pool disks together into larger volumes. If you want to mirror the volume from which Windows boots, you might want to use a hardware RAID controller, such as the one included on many motherboards.

> [!WARNING]
> To convert a dynamic disk back to a basic disk you must delete all volumes from the disk, permanently erasing all data on the disk. Make sure you back up any data you want to keep before proceeding.

## Changing a dynamic disk back to a basic disk

-   [Using the Windows interface](#to-change-a-dynamic-disk-back-to-a-basic-disk-using-the-windows-interface)
-   [Using a command line](#to-change-a-dynamic-disk-back-to-a-basic-disk-using-a-command-line)

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a member of the **Backup Operators** or **Administrators** group, at minimum, to complete these steps.

#### To change a dynamic disk back to a basic disk using the Windows interface

1.  Back up all volumes on the disk you want to convert from dynamic to basic.

2.  In Disk Management, right-click each volume on the dynamic disk you want to convert to a basic disk, and then click **Delete Volume** for each volume on the disk.

3.  When all volumes on the disk have been deleted, right-click the disk, and then click **Convert to Basic Disk**.

#### To change a dynamic disk back to a basic disk using a command line

1.  Back up all volumes on the disk you want to convert from dynamic to basic.

2.  Open a command prompt and type `diskpart`.

3.  At the **DISKPART** prompt, type `list disk`. Note the disk number you want to convert to basic.

4.  At the **DISKPART** prompt, type `select disk <disknumber>`.

5.  At the **DISKPART** prompt, type `detail disk <disknumber>`.

6.  For each volume on the disk, at the **DISKPART** prompt, type `select volume= <volumenumber>` and then type `delete volume`.

7.  At the **DISKPART** prompt, type `select disk <disknumber>`, specifying the disk number of the disk that you want to convert to a basic disk.

8.  At the **DISKPART** prompt, type `convert basic`.


| Value  | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **list disk**                         | Displays a list of disks and information about them, such as their size, the amount of available free space, whether the disk is a basic or dynamic disk, and whether the disk uses the Master Boot Record (MBR) or GUID Partition Table (GPT) partition style. The disk marked with an asterisk (*) has focus. |
| **select disk** <em>disknumber</em>   | Selects the specified disk, where <em>disknumber</em> is the disk number, and gives it focus.  |
| **detail disk** <em>disknumber</em>   | Displays the properties of the selected disk and the volumes on that disk.  |
| **select volume** <em>disknumber</em> | Selects the specified volume, where <em>disknumber</em> is the volume number, and gives it focus. If no volume is specified, the **select** command lists the current volume with focus. You can specify the volume by number, drive letter, or mount point path. On a basic disk, selecting a volume also gives the corresponding partition focus. |
| **delete volume**                     | Deletes the selected volume. You cannot delete the system volume, boot volume, or any volume that contains the active paging file or crash dump (memory dump). |
| **convert basic** | Converts an empty dynamic disk into a basic disk.  |

## Additional considerations

-   The disk must not contain any volumes or data before you can change it back to a basic disk. If you want to keep your data, back it up or move it to another volume before you convert the disk to a basic disk.
-   Once you change a dynamic disk back to a basic disk, you can create only partitions and logical drives on that disk.
