# Change a dynamic disk back to a basic disk

> **Applies To:** Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

Basic disks support only primary partitions, extended partitions, and logical drives. Basic disks have been supported in operating systems since MS-DOS, while dynamic disks have been supported in operating systems since Windows 2000.

<br />

> [!NOTE]
> The decision to convert a dynamic disk to a basic disk has implications that should be considered carefully. Before you convert disks, close any programs that are running on those disks. 

## Changing a dynamic disk back to a basic disk

-   [Using the Windows interface](#BKMK_WINUI)
-   [Using a command line](#BKMK_CMD)

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a member of the **Backup Operators** or **Administrators** group, at minimum, to complete these steps.

#### To change a dynamic disk back to a basic disk using the Windows interface
1.  Back up all volumes on the disk you want to convert from dynamic to basic.

2.  In Disk Management, right-click each volume on the dynamic disk you want to convert to a basic disk, and then click **Delete Volume** for each volume on the disk.

3.  When all volumes on the disk have been deleted, right-click the disk, and then click **Convert to Basic Disk**.

#### To change a dynamic disk back to a basic disk using a command line

1.  Back up all volumes on the disk you want to convert from dynamic to basic.

2.  Open a command prompt and type `diskpart`.

3.  At the **DISKPART** prompt, type `list disk`. Note the disk number you want to convert to basic.

4.  At the **DISKPART** prompt, type `select disk <disknumber>`.

5.  At the **DISKPART** prompt, type `detail disk <disknumber>`.

6.  For each volume on the disk, at the **DISKPART** prompt, type `select volume= <volumenumber>` and then type `delete volume`.

7.  At the **DISKPART** prompt, type `select disk <disknumber>`, specifying the disk number of the disk that you want to convert to a basic disk.

8.  At the **DISKPART** prompt, type `convert basic`.

| Value  | Description |
| --- |---|
| <p>**list disk**</p>                         | <p>Displays a list of disks and information about them, such as their size, the amount of available free space, whether the disk is a basic or dynamic disk, and whether the disk uses the Master Boot Record (MBR) or GUID Partition Table (GPT) partition style. The disk marked with an asterisk (*) has focus.</p> |
| <p>**select disk** <em>disknumber</em></p>   | <p>Selects the specified disk, where <em>disknumber</em> is the disk number, and gives it focus.</p>  |
| <p>**detail disk** <em>disknumber</em></p>   | <p>Displays the properties of the selected disk and the volumes on that disk.</p>  |
| <p>**select volume** <em>disknumber</em></p> | <p>Selects the specified volume, where <em>disknumber</em> is the volume number, and gives it focus. If no volume is specified, the **select** command lists the current volume with focus. You can specify the volume by number, drive letter, or mount point path. On a basic disk, selecting a volume also gives the corresponding partition focus.</p> |
| <p>**delete volume**</p>                     | <p>Deletes the selected volume. You cannot delete the system volume, boot volume, or any volume that contains the active paging file or crash dump (memory dump).</p> |
| <p>**convert basic**</p> | <p>Converts an empty dynamic disk into a basic disk.</p>  |

## Additional considerations

-   The disk must not contain any volumes or data before you can change it back to a basic disk. If you want to keep your data, back it up or move it to another volume before you convert the disk to a basic disk.
-   Once you change a dynamic disk back to a basic disk, you can create only partitions and logical drives on that disk.
