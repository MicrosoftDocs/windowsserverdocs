# Manage disks

> **Applies To:** Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

This topic and its subtopics discuss using Disk Management to manage the disks in a computer, and includes information about initializing new disks, converting disks between different partition styles, and how Windows handles the online status of new disks.

## Online and offline status

Disk Management displays whether a disk is online (available), or offline.

In Windows, by default, all newly-discovered disks are brought online with read and write access. In Windows Server, by default, newly-discovered disks are brought online with read and write access unless they are on a shared bus (such as SCSI, iSCSI, Serial Attached SCSI, or Fibre Channel). Disks on a shared bus are offline the first time they are detected.

If a disk is offline, you must bring it online before you can initialize it or create volumes on it.

To bring a disk online or take it offline, right-click the disk name and then choosing the appropriate action.
