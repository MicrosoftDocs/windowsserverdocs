# Manage disks

This article and the related topics show you how to use Disk Management to manage the disks in a computer. It includes information about how Windows manages the online status of new disks.

## Online and offline status

Disk Management displays whether a disk is online (available) or offline.

- In Windows, by default, all newly discovered disks are brought online with read and write access.
- In Windows Server, by default, newly discovered disks are brought online with read and write access unless they're on a shared bus (such as SCSI, iSCSI, Serial Attached SCSI, or Fibre Channel). Disks on a shared bus are offline the first time they're detected.

If a disk is offline, you must bring it online before you can initialize it or create volumes on it.

To bring a disk online or take it offline, follow these steps.

1. Open Disk Management. In the search box on the taskbar, enter **Computer Management** and select **Storage** > **Disk Management**.
1. Right-click the disk name, then select the appropriate action.
