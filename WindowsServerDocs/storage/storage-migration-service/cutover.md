# How cutover works in Storage Migration Service

Cutover is the phase of migration that moves the network identity of the source computer to the destination computer. After cutover, the source computer will still contain the same files as before, but it won't be available to users and apps.

## Summary

__Figure 1: Storage Migration Service cutover configuration__

Before cutover starts, you provide the network configuration information needed to cut over from the source computer to the destination computer. You can also choose a new unique name for the source computer or let Storage Migration Service create a random one.

Then, Storage Migration Service takes the following steps to cut over the source computer to the destination computer:

1. We connect to the source and destination computers. They should both already have the following firewall rules enabled inbound:
    * File and Printer Sharing (SMB-In), TCP Port 445
    * Netlogon Service (NP-In), TCP Port 445
    * Windows Management Instrumentation (DCOM-In), TCP Port 135
    * Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI-In), TCP, Any Port

2. We set security permissions on the destination computer in Active Directory Domain Services to match the source computer's permissions.

3. We create a temporary local user account on the source computer. If the computer is domain-joined, the account username is "MsftSmsStorMigratSvc". We disable the [local account token filter policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/951016/description-of-user-account-control-and-remote-restrictions-in-windows) on the source computer to allow the account through, and then connect to the source computer. We make this temporary account so that when we restart and remove the source computer from the domain later, we can still access the source computer.

4. We repeat the previous step on the destination computer.

5. We remove the source computer from the domain to free up its Active Directory account, which the destination computer will later take over.

6. We map network interfaces on the source computer and rename the source computer.

7. We add the source computer back to the domain. The source computer now has a new identity and is available to admins, but not to users and apps.

8. On the source computer, we remove any lingering alternate computer names, remove the temporary local account we created, and re-enable the local account token filter policy.

9. We remove the destination computer from the domain.

10. We replace the IP addresses on the destination computer with the IP information provided by the source, and then rename the destination computer to the source computer's original name.

11. We join the destination computer back to the domain. When joined, it uses the source computer's original Active Directory computer account. This preserves group memberships and security ACLs. The destination computer now has the identity of the source computer.

12. On the destination computer, we remove any lingering alternate computer names, remove the temporary local account we created, and re-enable the local account token filter policy, completing cutover.

After cutover finishes, the destination computer has taken on the identity of the source computer, and you can then decommission the source computer.

## Detailed stages

__Figure 2: Storage Migration Service showing a cutover stage description__

You can keep track of cutover progress through descriptions of each stage that appear as shown in the figure above. The following table shows each possible stage along with its progress, description, and any clarifying notes.
