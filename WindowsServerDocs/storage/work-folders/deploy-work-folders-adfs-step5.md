Use the following procedures to set up the domain-joined and non-domain joined Windows clients. You can use these clients to test whether files are syncing correctly between the clients' Work Folders.

## Set up a domain-joined client

### Install the AD FS and Work Folder certificates
You must install the AD FS and Work Folders certificates that you created earlier into the local computer certificate store on the domain-joined client machine.

Because you are installing self-signed certificates that can't be traced back to a publisher in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities certificate store, you must also copy the certificates to that store.

To install the certificates, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2.  Type **MMC**.

3.  On the **File** menu, click **Add/Remove Snap-in**.

4.  In the **Available snap-ins** list, select **Certificates**, and then click **Add**. The Certificates Snap\-in Wizard starts.

5.  Select **Computer account**, and then click **Next**.

6.  Select **Local computer: (the computer this console is running on)**, and then click **Finish**.

7.  Click **OK**.

8.  Expand the folder Console Root\Certificates\(Local Computer)\Personal\Certificates.

9. Right-click **Certificates**, click **All Tasks**, and then click **Import**.

10. Browse to the folder that contains the AD FS certificate, and follow the instructions in the wizard to import the file and place it in the certificate store.

11. Repeat steps 9 and 10, this time browsing to the Work Folders certificate and importing it.

12. Expand the folder Console Root\Certificates\(Local Computer)\Trusted Root Certification Authorities\Certificates.

13. Right-click **Certificates**, click **All Tasks**, and then click **Import**.

14. Browse to the folder that contains the AD FS certificate, and follow the instructions in the wizard to import the file and place it in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.

15. Repeat steps 13 and 14, this time browsing to the Work Folders certificate and importing it.

### Configure Work Folders on the client
To configure Work Folders on the client machine, follow these steps:

1. On the client machine, open **Control Panel** and click **Work Folders**.

2. Click **Set up Work Folders**.

3. On the **Enter your work email address** page, enter either the user's email address (for example, user@contoso.com) or the Work Folders URL (in the test example, https:\//workfolders.contoso.com), and then click **Next**.

4. If the user is connected to the corporate network, the authentication is performed by Windows Integrated Authentication. If the user is not connected to the corporate network, the authentication is performed by ADFS (OAuth) and the user will be prompted for credentials. Enter your credentials and click **OK**.

5. After you have authenticated, the **Introducing Work Folders** page is displayed, where you can optionally change the Work Folders directory location. Click **Next**.

6. The **Security Policies** page lists the security policies that you set up for Work Folders. Click **Next**.

7. A message is displayed stating that Work Folders has started syncing with your PC. Click **Close**.

8. The **Manage Work Folders** page shows the amount of space available on the server, sync status, and so on. If necessary, you can re-enter your credentials here. Close the window.

9. Your Work Folders folder opens automatically. You can add content to this folder to sync between your devices.

    For the purpose of the test example, add a test file to this Work Folders folder. After you set up Work Folders on the non-domain-joined machine, you will be able to sync files between the Work Folders on each machine.

## Set up a non-domain-joined client

### Install the AD FS and Work Folder certificates
Install the AD FS and Work Folders certificates on the non-domain-joined machine, using the same procedure that you used for the domain-joined machine.

### Update the hosts file
The hosts file on the non-domain-joined client must be updated for the test environment, because no public DNS records were created for Work Folders. Add these entries to the hosts file:

-  workfolders.domain

-  AD FS service name.domain

-  enterpriseregistration.domain

For the test example, use these values:

-  **10.0.0.10 workfolders.contoso.com**

-  **10.0.0.10 blueadfs.contoso.com**

-  **10.0.0.10 enterpriseregistration.contoso.com**

### Configure Work Folders on the client
Configure Work Folders on the non-domain-joined machine by using the same procedure that you used for the domain-joined machine.

When the new Work Folders folder opens on this client, you can see that the file from the domain-joined machine has already synced to the non-domain-joined machine. You can start adding content to the folder to sync between your devices.

This concludes the procedure for deploying Work Folders, AD FS and Web Application Proxy via the Windows Server UI.
