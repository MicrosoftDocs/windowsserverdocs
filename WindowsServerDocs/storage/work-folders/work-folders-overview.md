# Work Folders overview

>Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7

This topic discusses Work Folders, a role service for file servers running Windows Server that provides a consistent way for users to access their work files from their PCs and devices.  
  
If you're looking to download or use Work Folders on Windows 10, Windows 7, or an Android or iOS device, see the following:

- [Work Folders for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.workfolders)

## Role description

 With Work Folders users can store and access work files on personal computers and devices, often referred to as bring-your-own device (BYOD), in addition to corporate PCs. Users gain a convenient location to store work files, and they can access them from anywhere. Organizations maintain control over corporate data by storing the files on centrally managed file servers, and optionally specifying user device policies such as encryption and lock-screen passwords.  
  
 Work Folders can be deployed with existing deployments of Folder Redirection, Offline Files, and home folders. Work Folders stores user files in a folder on the server called a *sync share*. You can specify a folder that already contains user data, which enables you to adopt Work Folders without migrating servers and data or immediately phasing out your existing solution.  
  
## Practical applications

 Administrators can use Work Folders to provide users with access to their work files while keeping centralized storage and control over the organization's data. Some specific applications for Work Folders include:  
  
-   Provide a single point of access to work files from a user's work and personal computers and devices  
  
-   Access work files while offline, and then sync with the central file server when the PC or device next has Internet or intranet connectivity  
  
-   Deploy with existing deployments of Folder Redirection, Offline Files, and home folders  
  
-   Use existing file server management technologies, such as file classification and folder quotas, to manage user data  
  
-   Specify security policies to instruct user's PCs and devices to encrypt Work Folders and use a lock screen password  
  
-   Use Failover Clustering with Work Folders to provide a high-availability solution  
  
## Important functionality

 Work Folders includes the following functionality.  
  
| Functionality | Availability | Description |  
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |  
| Work Folders role service in Server Manager | Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2012 R2 | File and Storage Services provides a way to set up sync shares (folders that store user's work files), monitors Work Folders, and manages sync shares and user access |
| Work Folders cmdlets | Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2012 R2 | A Windows PowerShell module that contains comprehensive cmdlets for managing Work Folders servers |  
| Work Folders integration with Windows | Windows 10<br /><br /> Windows 8.1<br /><br /> Windows RT 8.1<br /><br /> Windows 7 (download required) | Work Folders provides the following functionality in Windows computers:<br /><br /> -   A Control Panel item that sets up and monitors Work Folders<br />-   File Explorer integration that enables easy access to files in Work Folders<br />-   A sync engine that transfers files to and from a central file server while maximizing battery life and system performance |

## New and changed functionality
  
The following table describes some of the major changes in Work Folders.  
  
| Feature/functionality | New or updated? | Description |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Azure AD Application Proxy support | Added to Windows 10 version 1703, Android, iOS | Remote users can securely access their files on the Work Folders server using Azure AD Application Proxy. |
| Faster change replication | Updated in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 | For Windows Server 2012 R2, when file changes are synced to the Work Folders server, clients are not notified of the change and wait up to 10 minutes to get the update. When using Windows Server 2016, the Work Folders server immediately notifies Windows 10 clients and the file changes are synced immediately. This capability is new in Windows Server 2016 and requires a Windows 10 client. If you're using an older client or the Work Folders server is Windows Server 2012 R2, the client will continue to poll every 10 minutes for changes. |  
| Integrated with Windows Information Protection (WIP) | Added to Windows 10 version 1607 | If an administrator deploys WIP, Work Folders can enforce data protection by encrypting the data on the PC. The encryption is using a key associated with the Enterprise ID, which can be remotely wiped by using a supported mobile device management package such as Microsoft Intune. |  
| Microsoft Office integration | Added to Windows 10 version 1511 | In Windows 8.1 you can navigate to Work Folders inside Office apps by clicking or tapping This PC and then navigating to the Work Folders location on your PC. In Windows 10 you can make it even easier to get to Work Folders by adding it to the list of locations that Office shows when saving or opening files. For more info, see [Work Folders in Windows 10](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-10/work-folders-in-windows-10) and  [Troubleshooting using Work Folders as a Place in Microsoft Office](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/32881.troubleshooting-using-work-folders-as-a-place-in-microsoft-office.aspx). |  
  
## Software requirements

Work Folders has the following software requirements for file servers and your network infrastructure:  
  
-   A server running Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2012 R2 for hosting sync shares with user files  
  
-   A volume formatted with the NTFS file system for storing user files  
  
-   To enforce password policies on Windows 7 PCs, you must use Group Policy password policies. You also have to exclude the Windows 7 PCs from Work Folders password policies (if you use them).

-   A server certificate for each file server that will host Work Folders. These certificates should be from a certification authority (CA) that is trusted by your users—ideally a public CA.

-   (Optional) An Active Directory Domain Services forest with the schema extensions in Windows Server 2012 R2 to support automatically referring PCs and devices to the correct file server when using multiple file servers.  
  
To enable users to sync across the Internet, there are additional requirements:  
  
-   The ability to make a server accessible from the Internet by creating publishing rules in your organization's reverse proxy or network gateway  
  
-   (Optional) A publicly registered domain name and the ability to create additional public DNS records for the domain  
  
-   (Optional) Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) infrastructure when using AD FS authentication  
  
Work Folders has the following software requirements for client computers:  
  
-   PCs and devices must be running one of the following operating systems:  
  
    -   Windows 10  
  
    -   Windows 8.1  
  
    -   Windows RT 8.1  
  
    -   Windows 7  
  
    -   Android 4.4 KitKat and later  
  
    -   iOS 10.2 and later  
  
-   Windows 7 PCs must be running one of the following editions of Windows:  
  
    -   Windows 7 Professional  
  
    -   Windows 7 Ultimate  
  
    -   Windows 7 Enterprise  
  
-   Windows 7 PCs must be joined to your organization's domain (they can't be joined to a workgroup).  
  
-   Enough free space on a local, NTFS-formatted drive to store all the user's files in Work Folders, plus an additional 6 GB of free space if Work Folders is located on the system drive, as it is by default. Work Folders uses the following location by default: **%USERPROFILE%\Work Folders**  
  
     However, users can change the location during setup (microSD cards and USB drives formatted with the NTFS file system are supported locations, though sync will stop if the drives are removed).  
  
     The maximum size for individual files is 10 GB by default. There is no per-user storage limit, although administrators can use the quotas functionality of File Server Resource Manager to implement quotas.  
  
-   Work Folders doesn't support rolling back the virtual machine state of client virtual machines. Instead perform backup and restore operations from inside the client virtual machine by using System Image Backup or another backup app.

## Server Manager information  

Work Folders is part of the File and Storage Services role. You can install Work Folders by using the Add Roles and Features Wizard or the `Install-WindowsFeature` cmdlet. Both methods accomplish the following:  
  
-   Adds the **Work Folders** page to **File and Storage Services** in Server Manager  
  
-   Installs the Windows Sync Shares service, which is used by Windows Server to host sync shares  
  
-   Installs the SyncShare Windows PowerShell module to manage Work Folders on the server  
  
## Interoperability with Windows Azure virtual machines

 You can run this Windows Server role service on a virtual machine in Windows Azure. This scenario has been tested with Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016.
