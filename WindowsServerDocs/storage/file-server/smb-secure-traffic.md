# Secure SMB Traffic in Windows Server

As a defense in depth measure, you can use segmentation and isolation techniques to secure SMB
traffic and reduce threats between devices on your network.

SMB is used for file sharing, printing, and inter-process communication such as named pipes and RPC.
It's also used as a network data fabric for technologies such as Storage Spaces Direct, Storage
Replica, Hyper-V Live Migration, and Cluster Shared Volumes. Use the following sections to configure
SMB traffic segmentation and endpoint isolation to help prevent outbound and lateral network
communications.

## Block inbound SMB access

Block TCP port 445 inbound from the internet at your corporate hardware firewalls. Blocking inbound
SMB traffic protects devices inside your network by preventing access from the internet.

If you want users to access their files inbound at the edge of your network, you can use SMB over
QUIC. This uses UDP port 443 by default and provides a TLS 1.3-encrypted security tunnel like a VPN
for SMB traffic. The solution requires Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure
Edition file servers running on Azure Stack HCI. For more information, see [SMB over QUIC](https://aka.ms/smboverquic).

## Block outbound SMB access

Block TCP port 445 outbound to the internet at your corporate firewall. Blocking outbound
SMB traffic prevents devices inside your network from sending data using SMB to the internet.

It is unlikely you need to allow any outbound SMB using TCP port 445 to the internet unless you
require it as part of a public cloud offering. The primary scenarios include Azure Files and Office
365.

If you are using Azure Files SMB, use a VPN for outbound VPN traffic. By
using a VPN, you restrict the outbound traffic to the required service IP ranges. For more
information about Azure Cloud and Office 365 IP address ranges, see:

- Azure IP ranges and service tags:

  - [public cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519)
  - [US government cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57063)
  - [Germany cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57064)
  - [China cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=57064).
  
  The JSON files are updated weekly and include versioning both for the full file and each
  individual service tag. The *AzureCloud* tag provides the IP ranges for the cloud (Public, US
  government, Germany, or China) and is grouped by region within that cloud. Service tags in the
  file will increase as Azure services are added.
- [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges).

With Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition, you can use SMB over QUIC to
connect to file servers in Azure. This uses UDP port 443 by default and provides a TLS 1.3-encrypted
security tunnel like a VPN for the SMB traffic. For more information, see
[SMB over QUIC](https://aka.ms/smboverquic).

## Inventory SMB usage and shares

By inventorying your network's SMB traffic, you get an understanding of traffic that is occurring
and can determine if it's necessary. Use the following checklist of questions to help identify
unnecessary SMB traffic.

For server endpoints:

1. Which server endpoints require inbound SMB access to do their role? Do they need inbound
   access from all clients, certain networks, or certain nodes?
1. Of the remaining server endpoints, is inbound SMB access necessary?

For client endpoints:

1. Which client endpoints (for example, Windows 10) require inbound SMB access? Do they need inbound
   access from all clients, certain networks, or certain nodes?
1. Of the remaining client endpoints, is inbound SMB access necessary?
1. Of the remaining client endpoints, do they need to run the SMB server service?

For all endpoints, determine if you allow outbound SMB in the safest and most minimal fashion.

Review server built-in roles and features that require SMB inbound. For example, file servers and
domain controllers require SMB inbound to do their role. For more information on built-in roles
and feature network port requirements, see
[Service overview and network port requirements for Windows](/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/service-overview-and-network-port-requirements).

Review servers that need to be accessed from inside the network. For example, domain controllers and
file servers likely need to be accessed anywhere in the network. However, application server access
may be limited to a set of other application servers on the same subnet. You can use the following
tools and features to help you inventory SMB access:

- Use the `Get-FileShareInfo` command from the [AZSBTools](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AZSBTools) module set to examine shares on servers and clients.
- Enable an [audit trail of SMB inbound access](/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-5140) using the registry key `Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\Audit Policies\Object Access\File Share`. Since the number of events may be large, consider enabling for a specified amount of time or use [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor).

Examining SMB logs lets you know which nodes are communicating with endpoints over SMB. You can
decide if an endpoint's shares are in use and understand which to exist.

## Configure Windows Defender Firewall

Use firewall rules to add extra connection security. Configure rules to block both inbound and
outbound communications that include exceptions. An outbound firewall policy that prevents use of
SMB connections both outside and inside your managed network while allowing access to the minimum
set of servers and no other devices is a lateral defense-in-depth measure.

For information on the SMB firewall rules you need to set for inbound and outbound connections, see
the support article
[Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections-and-entering-or-leaving-the-network-c0541db7-2244-0dce-18fd-14a3ddeb282a).

The support article includes templates for:

- Inbound rules that are based on any kind of network profile.
- Outbound rules for private/domain (trusted) networks.
- Outbound rules for guest/public (untrusted) networks. This template is important to enforce on
  mobile devices and home-based telecommuters that are not behind your firewall that is blocking
  outbound traffic. Enforcing these rules on laptops reduces the odds of phishing attacks that send
  users to malicious servers to harvest credentials or run attack code.
- Outbound rules that contain an override *allowlist* for domain controllers and file servers
  called *Allow the connection if secure*.

To use the null encapsulation IPSEC authentication, you must create a Security Connection rule on
all computers in your network that are participating in the rules. Otherwise, the firewall
exceptions won't work and you'll only be arbitrarily blocking.

> [!CAUTION]
> You should test the Security Connection rule before broad deployment. An incorrect rule
> could prevent users from accessing their data.

To create a *Connection Security* rule, use Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security control
panel or snap-in:

1. In Windows Defender Firewall, select *Connection Security Rules* and choose a **New rule**.
1. In *Rule Type*, select **Isolation** then select **Next**.
1. In *Requirements*, select **Request authentication for inbound and outbound connections** then select **Next**.
1. In *Authentication Method*, select **Computer and User (Kerberos V5)** then select **Next**.
1. In *Profile*, check all profiles (*Domain, Private, Public*) then select **Next**.
1. Enter a name your rule then select **Finish**.

Remember, the Connection Security rule must be created on all clients and servers participating in
your inbound and outbound rules or they will be blocked from connecting SMB outbound. These rules
may already be in place from other security efforts in your environment and like the firewall
inbound/outbound rules, can be deployed via group policy.

When configuring rules based on the templates in the
[Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections-and-entering-or-leaving-the-network-c0541db7-2244-0dce-18fd-14a3ddeb282a)
support article, set the following to customize the *Allow the connection if secure* action:

1. In the *Action* step, select **Allow the connection if it is secure** then select **Customize**.
1. In *Customize Allow if Secure Settings*, select **Allow the connection to use null encapsulation**.

The *Allow the connection if it is secure* option allows override of a global block rule. You can use
the easy but least secure *Allow the connection to use null encapsulation* with *override block
rules, which relies on Kerberos and domain membership for authentication. Windows Defender Firewall
allows for more secure options like IPSEC.

For more information about configuring the firewall, see [Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security deployment overview](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-deployment-guide).

### Updated firewall rules (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows Server Insiders Edition is currently in PREVIEW.
> This information relates to a prerelease product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

Beginning with [Windows 11 Insider preview Build 25992 (Canary)](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/11/08/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25992-canary-channel/) and [Windows Server Preview Build 25997](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-server-insiders/announcing-windows-server-preview-build-25997/m-p/3983949), the built-in firewall rules doesn't contain the SMB NetBIOS ports anymore. In earlier versions of Windows Server, when you created a share, the firewall automatically enabled certain rules in the File and Printer Sharing group. In particular, the built-in firewall automatically used inbound NetBIOS ports 137 through 139. Shares made with SMB2 or later don't use NetBIOS ports 137-139. If you need to use an SMB1 server for legacy compatibility reasons, you must manually reconfigure the firewall to open those ports

We made this change to improve network security. This change brings SMB firewall rules more in line with the standard behavior for the Windows Server *File Server* role. By default, the firewall rule only open the minimum number of ports required for sharing data. Administrators can reconfigure the rules to restore the legacy ports.

## Disable SMB Server if unused

Windows clients and some of your Windows Servers on your network may not require the SMB Server
service to be running. If the SMB Server service isn't required, you can disable the service. Before
disabling SMB Server service, be sure no applications and processes on the computer require the
service.

You can use Group Policy Preferences to disable the service on a large number of machines when you
are ready to implement. For more information about configuring Group Policy Preferences, see
[Configure a Service Item](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-r2-and-2008/cc732482%28v%3Dws.10%29).

## Test and deploy using policy

Begin by testing using small-scale, hand-made deployments on select servers and clients. Use phased
group policy rollouts to make these changes. For example, start with the heaviest user of SMB such
as your own IT team. If your team's laptops and apps and file share access work well after deploying
your inbound and outbound firewall rules, create test group policy within your broad test and QA
environments. Based on results, start sampling some departmental machines, then expand out.
