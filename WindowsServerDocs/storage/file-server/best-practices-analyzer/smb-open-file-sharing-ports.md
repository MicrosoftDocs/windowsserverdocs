## Issue

> *The firewall ports necessary for file and printer sharing are not open (ports 445 and 139).*

## Impact

> *Computers will not be able to access shared folders and other Server Message Block (SMB)-based network services on this server.*

## Resolution

> *Enable File and Printer Sharing to communicate through the computer's firewall.*

Membership in the **Administrators** group, or equivalent, is the minimum required to complete this procedure.

## To open the firewall ports to enable file and printer sharing

1.  Open Control Panel, click **System and Security**, and then click **Windows Firewall**.

2.  In the left pane, click **Advanced settings**, and in the console tree, click **Inbound Rules**.

3.  Under **Inbound Rules**, locate the rules **File and Printer Sharing (NB-Session-In)** and **File and Printer Sharing (SMB-In)**.

4.  For each rule, right-click the rule, and then click **Enable Rule**.
