A referral is an ordered list of targets that a client computer receives from a domain controller or namespace server when the user accesses a namespace root or folder with targets in the namespace. You can adjust how long clients cache a referral before requesting a new one.

## To change the amount of time that clients cache namespace root referrals

1.  Click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **DFS Management**.

2.  In the console tree, under the **Namespaces** node, right-click a namespace, and then click **Properties**.

3.  On the **Referrals** tab, in the **Cache duration (in seconds)** text box, type the amount of time (in seconds) that clients cache namespace root referrals. The default setting is 300 seconds (five minutes).

> [!TIP]
> To change the amount of time that clients cache namespace root referrals by using Windows PowerShell, use the [Set-DfsnRoot TimeToLiveSec](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc753448(v=ws.11))
cmdlet. These cmdlets were introduced in Windows ServerÂ 2012.

## To change the amount of time that clients cache folder referrals
