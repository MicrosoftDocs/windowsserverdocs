# Performance history for clusters

> Applies to: Windows Server 2019

This sub-topic of [Performance history for Storage Spaces Direct](performance-history.md) describes the performance history collected for clusters.

There are no series that originate at the cluster level. Instead, server series, such as `clusternode.cpu.usage`, are aggregated for all servers in the cluster. Volume series, such as `volume.iops.total`, are aggregated for all volumes in the cluster. And drive series, such as `physicaldisk.size.total`, are aggregated for all drives in the cluster.

## Usage in PowerShell

Use the [Get-Cluster](/powershell/module/failoverclusters/get-cluster) cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Get-Cluster | Get-ClusterPerf
```
