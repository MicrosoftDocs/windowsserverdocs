## Create a three-way mirror volume

To create a three-way mirror volume in Windows Admin Center: 

1. In Windows Admin Center, connect to a Storage Spaces Direct cluster, and then select **Volumes** from the **Tools** pane.
2. On the Volumes page, select the **Inventory** tab, and then select **Create volume**.
3. In the **Create volume** pane, enter a name for the volume, and leave **Resiliency** as **Three-way mirror**.
4. In **Size on HDD**, specify the size of the volume. For example, 5 TB (terabytes).
5. Select **Create**.

Depending on the size, creating the volume can take a few minutes. Notifications in the upper-right will let you know when the volume is created. The new volume appears in the Inventory list.

## Create a mirror-accelerated parity volume

Mirror-accelerated parity reduces the footprint of the volume on the HDD. For example, a three-way mirror volume would mean that for every 10 terabytes of size, you will need 30 terabytes as footprint. To reduce the overhead in footprint, create a volume with mirror-accelerated parity. This reduces the footprint from 30 terabytes to just 22 terabytes, even with only 4 servers, by mirroring the most active 20 percent of data, and using parity, which is more space efficient, to store the rest. You can adjust this ratio of parity and mirror to make the performance versus capacity tradeoff that's right for your workload. For example, 90 percent parity and 10 percent mirror yields less performance but streamlines the footprint even further.

To create a volume with mirror-accelerated parity in Windows Admin Center:

1. In Windows Admin Center, connect to a Storage Spaces Direct cluster, and then select **Volumes** from the **Tools** pane.
2. On the Volumes page, select the **Inventory** tab, and then select **Create volume**.
3. In the **Create volume** pane, enter a name for the volume.
4. In **Resiliency**, select **Mirror-accelerated parity**.
5. In **Parity percentage**, select the percentage of parity.
6. Select **Create**.

## Open volume and add files

To open a volume and add files to the volume in Windows Admin Center:

1. In Windows Admin Center, connect to a Storage Spaces Direct cluster, and then select **Volumes** from the **Tools** pane.
2. On the Volumes page, select the **Inventory** tab.
2. In the list of volumes, select the name of the volume that you want to open.

    On the volume details page, you can see the path to the volume.

4. At the top of the page, select **Open**. This launches the Files tool in Windows Admin Center.
5. Navigate to the path of the volume. Here you can browse the files in the volume.
6. Select **Upload**, and then select a file to upload.
7. Use the browser **Back** button to go back to the Tools pane in Windows Admin Center.

## Turn on deduplication and compression

Deduplication and compression is managed per volume. Deduplication and compression uses a post-processing model, which means that you won't see savings until it runs. When it does, it'll work over all files, even those that were there from before.

1. In Windows Admin Center, connect to a Storage Spaces Direct cluster, and then select **Volumes** from the **Tools** pane.
2. On the Volumes page, select the **Inventory** tab.
3. In the list of volumes, select the name of the volume that want to manage.
4. On the volume details page, click the switch labeled **Deduplication and compression**.
5. In the Enable deduplication pane, select the deduplication mode.

    Instead of complicated settings, Windows Admin Center lets you choose between ready-made profiles for different workloads. If you're not sure, use the default setting.

6. Select **Enable**.

## Create volumes using PowerShell

We recommend using the **New-Volume** cmdlet to create volumes for Storage Spaces Direct. It provides the fastest and most straightforward experience. This single cmdlet automatically creates the virtual disk, partitions and formats it, creates the volume with matching name, and adds it to cluster shared volumes â€“ all in one easy step.

The **New-Volume** cmdlet has four parameters you'll always need to provide:

- **FriendlyName:** Any string you want, for example *"Volume1"*
- **FileSystem:** Either **CSVFS_ReFS** (recommended) or **CSVFS_NTFS**
- **StoragePoolFriendlyName:** The name of your storage pool, for example *"S2D on ClusterName"*
- **Size:** The size of the volume, for example *"10TB"*

   > [!NOTE]
   > Windows, including PowerShell, counts using binary (base-2) numbers, whereas drives are often labeled using decimal (base-10) numbers. This explains why a "one terabyte" drive, defined as 1,000,000,000,000 bytes, appears in Windows as about "909 GB". This is expected. When creating volumes using **New-Volume**, you should specify the **Size** parameter in binary (base-2) numbers. For example, specifying "909GB" or "0.909495TB" will create a volume of approximately 1,000,000,000,000 bytes.

### Example: With 2 or 3 servers

To make things easier, if your deployment has only two servers, Storage Spaces Direct will automatically use two-way mirroring for resiliency. If your deployment has only three servers, it will automatically use three-way mirroring.

```PowerShell
New-Volume -FriendlyName "Volume1" -FileSystem CSVFS_ReFS -StoragePoolFriendlyName S2D* -Size 1TB
```

### Example: With 4+ servers

If you have four or more servers, you can use the optional **ResiliencySettingName** parameter to choose your resiliency type.

-	**ResiliencySettingName:** Either **Mirror** or **Parity**.

In the following example, *"Volume2"* uses three-way mirroring and *"Volume3"* uses dual parity (often called "erasure coding").

```PowerShell
New-Volume -FriendlyName "Volume2" -FileSystem CSVFS_ReFS -StoragePoolFriendlyName S2D* -Size 1TB -ResiliencySettingName Mirror
New-Volume -FriendlyName "Volume3" -FileSystem CSVFS_ReFS -StoragePoolFriendlyName S2D* -Size 1TB -ResiliencySettingName Parity
```

### Example: Using storage tiers

In deployments with three types of drives, one volume can span the SSD and HDD tiers to reside partially on each. Likewise, in deployments with four or more servers, one volume can mix mirroring and dual parity to reside partially on each.

To help you create such volumes, Storage Spaces Direct provides default tier templates called *Performance* and *Capacity*. They encapsulate definitions for three-way mirroring on the faster capacity drives (if applicable), and dual parity on the slower capacity drives (if applicable).

You can see them by running the **Get-StorageTier** cmdlet.

```PowerShell
Get-StorageTier | Select FriendlyName, ResiliencySettingName, PhysicalDiskRedundancy
```

To create tiered volumes, reference these tier templates using the **StorageTierFriendlyNames** and **StorageTierSizes** parameters of the **New-Volume** cmdlet. For example, the following cmdlet creates one volume which mixes three-way mirroring and dual parity in 30:70 proportions.

```PowerShell
New-Volume -FriendlyName "Volume4" -FileSystem CSVFS_ReFS -StoragePoolFriendlyName S2D* -StorageTierFriendlyNames Performance, Capacity -StorageTierSizes 300GB, 700GB
```

## Create volumes using Failover Cluster Manager

You can also create volumes using the *New Virtual Disk Wizard (Storage Spaces Direct)* followed by the *New Volume Wizard* from Failover Cluster Manager, although this workflow has many more manual steps and is not recommended.

There are three major steps:

### Step 1: Create virtual disk

![New Virtual Disk](media/creating-volumes/GUI-Step-1.png)

1. In Failover Cluster Manager, navigate to **Storage** -> **Pools**.
2. Select **New Virtual Disk** from the Actions pane on the right, or right-click the pool and select **New Virtual Disk**.
3. Select the storage pool and click **OK**. The *New Virtual Disk Wizard (Storage Spaces Direct)* will open.
4. Use the wizard to name the virtual disk and specify its size.
5. Review your selections and click **Create**.
6. Be sure to check the box marked **Create a volume when this wizard closes** before closing.

### Step 2: Create volume

The *New Volume Wizard* will open.

7. Select the virtual disk you just created and click **Next**.
8. Specify the volume's size (default: the same size as the virtual disk) and click **Next**. 
9. Assign the volume to a drive letter or choose **Don't assign to a drive letter** and click **Next**.
10. Specify the filesystem to use, leave the allocation unit size as *Default*, name the volume, and click **Next**.
11. Review your selections and click **Create**, then **Close**.

### Step 3: Add to cluster shared volumes

![Add to Cluster Shared Volumes](media/creating-volumes/GUI-Step-2.png)

12. In Failover Cluster Manager, navigate to **Storage** -> **Disks**.
13. Select the virtual disk you just created and select **Add to Cluster Shared Volumes** from the Actions pane on the right, or right-click the virtual disk and select **Add to Cluster Shared Volumes**.

You're done! Repeat as needed to create more than one volume.
