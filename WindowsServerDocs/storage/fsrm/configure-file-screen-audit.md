# Configure File Screen Audit

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2

By using File Server Resource Manager, you can record file screening activity in an auditing database. The information saved in this database is used to generate the File Screening Audit report.

> [!Important]
> If the **Record file screening activity in the auditing database** check box is cleared, the File Screening Audit Reports will not contain any information.

## To configure file screen audit

1.  In the console tree, right-click **File Server Resource Manager**, and then click **Configure Options**. The **File Server Resource Manager Options** dialog box opens.

2.  On the **File Screen Audit** tab, select the **Record file screening activity in the auditing database** check box.

3.  Click **OK**. All file screening activity will now be stored in the auditing database, and it can be viewed by running a File Screening Audit report.
