# Generate reports on demand

You can generate reports on demand using the **File Server Resource Manager** (FSRM). With these reports, you can analyze the different aspects of current disk usage on the server. Current data is gathered before the reports are generated.

When you generate reports on demand, reports are saved to a default location unless otherwise specified in **FSRM > Action > Configure Options > Report Locations**. No report task is created for later use. You can view the reports immediately after they're generated or e-mail the reports to a group of administrators. If an administrator decides to change the default locations where reports are generated, they must also secure any new Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path with access limited to authorized users. Secured access ensures you can configure paths to prevent exploitation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose to open the reports immediately, you must wait while the reports are generated. Processing time varies depending on the types of reports and the scope of the data.

## Prerequisites

The following must be installed to use this feature:

- A Windows Server with the **File and Storage Services** role service installed. To learn more, see [Install or Uninstall Roles, Role Services, or Features](/windows-server/administration/server-manager/install-or-uninstall-roles-role-services-or-features).

- An account with Administrative privileges.
