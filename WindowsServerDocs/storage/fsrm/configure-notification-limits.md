# Configure Notification Limits

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2

To reduce the number of notifications that accumulate for repeatedly exceeding a quota threshold or attempting to save an unauthorized file, File Server Resource Manager applies time limits to the following notification types:

-   E-mail
-   Event log
-   Command
-   Report

Each limit specifies a period of time before another configured notification of the same type is generated for an identical issue.

A default 60-minute limit is set for each notification type, but you can change these limits. The limit applies to all the notifications of a given type, whether they are generated by quota thresholds or by file screening events.

## To specify a standard notification limit for each notification type

1.  In the console tree, right-click **File Server Resource Manager**, and then click **Configure Options**. The **File Server Resource Manager Options** dialog box opens.

2.  On the **Notification Limits** tab, enter a value in minutes for each notification type that is shown.

3.  Click **OK**.

> [!Note]
> To customize time limits that are associated with notifications for a specific quota or file screen, you can use the File Server Resource Manager command-line tools **Dirquota.exe** and **Filescrn.exe**, or use the [File Server Resource Manager](/powershell/module/fileserverresourcemanager/) cmdlets.
