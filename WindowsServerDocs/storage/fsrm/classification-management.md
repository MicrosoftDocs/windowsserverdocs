Classification properties are used to categorize files and can be used to select files for scheduled file management tasks.

There are many ways to classify a file. One way is to create a classification property that assigns a value to all files within a specified directory. Another way is to create rules to decide what value to set for a given property.

This section includes the following topics:

-   [Create a Classification Property](create-classification-property.md)
-   [Create an Automatic Classification Rule](create-automatic-classification-rule.md)
