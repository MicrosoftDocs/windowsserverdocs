# Setting File Server Resource Manager Options

The general File Server Resource Manager options can be set in the **File Server Resource Manager Options** dialog box. These settings are used throughout the nodes, and some of them can be modified when you work with quotas, screen files, or generate storage reports.

This section includes the following topics:

-   [Configure E-Mail Notifications](configure-email-notifications.md)
-   [Configure Notification Limits](configure-notification-limits.md)
-   [Configure Storage Reports](configure-storage-reports.md)
-   [Configure File Screen Audit](configure-file-screen-audit.md)
