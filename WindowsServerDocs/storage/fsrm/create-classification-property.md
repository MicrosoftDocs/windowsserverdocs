# Create a Classification Property

> Applies to: Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2

Classification properties are used to assign values to files within a specified folder or volume. There are many property types that you can choose from, depending on your needs. The following table defines the available property types.

|Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Yes/No | A Boolean property that can be **Yes** or **No**. When combining multiple values during classification or from file content, a **No** value will be overridden by a **Yes** value. |
| Date-time | A simple date/time property. When combining multiple values during classification or from file content, conflicting values will prevent re-classification. |
| Number | A simple number property. When combining multiple values during classification or from file content, conflicting values will prevent re-classification. |
| Ordered List | A list of fixed values. Only one value can be assigned to a property at a time. When combining multiple values during classification or from file content, the value highest in the list will be used. |
| String | A simple string property. When combining multiple values during classification or from file content conflicting values will prevent re-classification. |
| Multi-choice | A list of values that can be assigned to a property. More than one value can be assigned to a property at a time. When combining multiple values during classification or from file content, each value in the list will be used. |
| Multi-string | A list of strings that can be assigned to a property. More than one value can be assigned to a property at a time. When combining multiple values during classification or from file content, each value in the list will be used. |
