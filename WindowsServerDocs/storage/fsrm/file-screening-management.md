# File Screening Management

> Applies to: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server (Semi-Annual Channel), Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2

On the **File Screening Management** node of the File Server Resource Manager MMC snap-in, you can perform the following tasks:

-   Create file screens to control the types of files that users can save, and generate notifications when users attempt to save unauthorized files.
-   Define file screening templates that can be applied to new volumes or folders and that can be used across an organization.
-   Create file screening exceptions that extend the flexibility of the file screening rules.

For example, you can:

-   Ensure that no music files are stored on personal folders on a server, yet you could allow storage of specific types of media files that support legal rights management or comply with company policies. In the same scenario, you might want to give a vice president in the company special privileges to store any type of files in his personal folder.
-   Implement a screening process to notify you by e-mail when an executable file is stored on a shared folder, including information about the user who stored the file and the file's exact location, so that you can take the appropriate precautionary steps.
