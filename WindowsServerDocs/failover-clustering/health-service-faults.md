# Health Service faults

> Applies to: Windows Server 2016

## What are faults

The Health Service constantly monitors your Storage Spaces Direct cluster to detect problems and generate "faults". One new cmdlet displays any current faults, allowing you to easily verify the health of your deployment without looking at every entity or feature in turn. Faults are designed to be precise, easy to understand, and actionable.

Each fault contains five important fields:

-   Severity
-   Description of the problem
-   Recommended next step(s) to address the problem
-   Identifying information for the faulting entity
-   Its physical location (if applicable)

For example, here is a typical fault:

```
Severity: MINOR
Reason: Connectivity has been lost to the physical disk.
Recommendation: Check that the physical disk is working and properly connected.
Part: Manufacturer Contoso, Model XYZ9000, Serial 123456789
Location: Seattle DC, Rack B07, Node 4, Slot 11
```

 >[!NOTE]
 > The physical location is derived from your fault domain configuration. For more information about fault domains, see [Fault Domains in Windows Server 2016](fault-domains.md). If you do not provide this information, the location field will be less helpful - for example, it may only show the slot number.

## Root cause analysis

The Health Service can assess the potential causality among faulting entities to identify and combine faults which are consequences of the same underlying problem. By recognizing chains of effect, this makes for less chatty reporting. For example, if a server is down, it is expected than any drives within the server will also be without connectivity. Therefore, only one fault will be raised for the root cause - in this case, the server.

## Usage in PowerShell

To see any current faults in PowerShell, run this cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Get-StorageSubSystem Cluster* | Debug-StorageSubSystem
```

This returns any faults which affect the overall Storage Spaces Direct cluster. Most often, these faults relate to hardware or configuration. If there are no faults, this cmdlet will return nothing.

>[!NOTE]
> In a non-production environment, and at your own risk, you can experiment with this feature by triggering faults yourself - for example, by removing one physical disk or shutting down one node. Once the fault has appeared, re-insert the physical disk or restart the node and the fault will disappear again.

You can also view faults that are affecting only specific volumes or file shares with the following cmdlets:

```PowerShell
Get-Volume -FileSystemLabel <Label> | Debug-Volume

Get-FileShare -Name <Name> | Debug-FileShare
```

This returns any faults that affect only the specific volume or file share. Most often, these faults relate to capacity planning, data resiliency, or features like Storage Quality-of-Service or Storage Replica.

## Usage in .NET and C#

### Connect

In order to query the Health Service, you will need to establish a **CimSession** with the cluster. To do so, you will need some things that are only available in full .NET, meaning you cannot readily do this directly from a web or mobile app. These code samples will use C\#, the most straightforward choice for this data access layer.

```
using System.Security;
using Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure;

public CimSession Connect(string Domain = "...", string Computer = "...", string Username = "...", string Password = "...")
{
    SecureString PasswordSecureString = new SecureString();
    foreach (char c in Password)
    {
        PasswordSecureString.AppendChar(c);
    }

    CimCredential Credentials = new CimCredential(
        PasswordAuthenticationMechanism.Default, Domain, Username, PasswordSecureString);
    WSManSessionOptions SessionOptions = new WSManSessionOptions();
    SessionOptions.AddDestinationCredentials(Credentials);
    Session = CimSession.Create(Computer, SessionOptions);
    return Session;
}
```

The provided Username should be a local Administrator of the target Computer.

It is recommended that you construct the Password **SecureString** directly from user input in real-time, so their password is never stored in memory in cleartext. This helps mitigate a variety of security concerns. But in practice, constructing it as above is common for prototyping purposes.

### Discover objects

With the **CimSession** established, you can query Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) on the cluster.

Before you can get Faults or Metrics, you will need to get instances of several relevant objects. First, the **MSFT\_StorageSubSystem** which represents Storage Spaces Direct on the cluster. Using that, you can get every **MSFT\_StorageNode** in the cluster, and every **MSFT\_Volume**, the data volumes. Finally, you will need the **MSFT\_StorageHealth**, the Health Service itself, too.

```
CimInstance Cluster;
List<CimInstance> Nodes;
List<CimInstance> Volumes;
CimInstance HealthService;

public void DiscoverObjects(CimSession Session)
{
    // Get MSFT_StorageSubSystem for Storage Spaces Direct
    Cluster = Session.QueryInstances(@"root\microsoft\windows\storage", "WQL", "SELECT * FROM MSFT_StorageSubSystem")
        .First(Instance => (Instance.CimInstanceProperties["FriendlyName"].Value.ToString()).Contains("Cluster"));

    // Get MSFT_StorageNode for each cluster node
    Nodes = Session.EnumerateAssociatedInstances(Cluster.CimSystemProperties.Namespace,
        Cluster, "MSFT_StorageSubSystemToStorageNode", null, "StorageSubSystem", "StorageNode").ToList();

    // Get MSFT_Volumes for each data volume
    Volumes = Session.EnumerateAssociatedInstances(Cluster.CimSystemProperties.Namespace,
        Cluster, "MSFT_StorageSubSystemToVolume", null, "StorageSubSystem", "Volume").ToList();

    // Get MSFT_StorageHealth itself
    HealthService = Session.EnumerateAssociatedInstances(Cluster.CimSystemProperties.Namespace,
        Cluster, "MSFT_StorageSubSystemToStorageHealth", null, "StorageSubSystem", "StorageHealth").First();
}
```

These are the same objects you get in PowerShell using cmdlets like **Get-StorageSubSystem**, **Get-StorageNode**, and **Get-Volume**.

You can access all the same properties, documented at [Storage Management API Classes](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/stormgmt/storage-management-api-classes).

```
using System.Diagnostics;

foreach (CimInstance Node in Nodes)
{
    // For illustration, write each node's Name to the console. You could also write State (up/down), or anything else!
    Debug.WriteLine("Discovered Node " + Node.CimInstanceProperties["Name"].Value.ToString());
}
```

### Query faults

Invoke **Diagnose** to get any current faults scoped to the target **CimInstance**, which be the cluster or any volume.

The complete list of faults available at each scope in Windows Server 2016 is documented below.

```
public void GetFaults(CimSession Session, CimInstance Target)
{
    // Set Parameters (None)
    CimMethodParametersCollection FaultsParams = new CimMethodParametersCollection();
    // Invoke API
    CimMethodResult Result = Session.InvokeMethod(Target, "Diagnose", FaultsParams);
    IEnumerable<CimInstance> DiagnoseResults = (IEnumerable<CimInstance>)Result.OutParameters["DiagnoseResults"].Value;
    // Unpack
    if (DiagnoseResults != null)
    {
        foreach (CimInstance DiagnoseResult in DiagnoseResults)
        {
            // TODO: Whatever you want!
        }
    }
}
```

### Optional: MyFault class

It may make sense for you to construct and persist your own representation of faults. For example, this **MyFault** class stores several key properties of faults, including the **FaultId**, which can be used later to associate update or remove notifications, or to deduplicate in the event that the same fault is detected multiple times, for whatever reason.

```
public class MyFault {
    public String FaultId { get; set; }
    public String Reason { get; set; }
    public String Severity { get; set; }
    public String Description { get; set; }
    public String Location { get; set; }

    // Constructor
    public MyFault(CimInstance DiagnoseResult)
    {
        CimKeyedCollection<CimProperty> Properties = DiagnoseResult.CimInstanceProperties;
        FaultId     = Properties["FaultId"                  ].Value.ToString();
        Reason      = Properties["Reason"                   ].Value.ToString();
        Severity    = Properties["PerceivedSeverity"        ].Value.ToString();
        Description = Properties["FaultingObjectDescription"].Value.ToString();
        Location    = Properties["FaultingObjectLocation"   ].Value.ToString();
    }
}
```

```
List<MyFault> Faults = new List<MyFault>;

foreach (CimInstance DiagnoseResult in DiagnoseResults)
{
    Faults.Add(new Fault(DiagnoseResult));
}
```

The complete list of properties in each fault (**DiagnoseResult**) is documented below.

### Fault events

When Faults are created, removed, or updated, the Health Service generates WMI events. These are essential to keeping your application state in sync without frequent polling, and can help with things like determining when to send email alerts, for example. To subscribe to these events, this sample code uses the Observer Design Pattern again.

First, subscribe to **MSFT\_StorageFaultEvent** events.

```
public void ListenForFaultEvents()
{
    IObservable<CimSubscriptionResult> Events = Session.SubscribeAsync(
        @"root\microsoft\windows\storage", "WQL", "SELECT * FROM MSFT_StorageFaultEvent");
    // Subscribe the Observer
    FaultsObserver<CimSubscriptionResult> Observer = new FaultsObserver<CimSubscriptionResult>(this);
    IDisposable Disposeable = Events.Subscribe(Observer);
}
```

Next, implement an Observer whose **OnNext()** method will be invoked whenever a new event is generated.

Each event contains **ChangeType** indicating whether a fault is being created, removed, or updated, and the relevant **FaultId**.

In addition, they contain all the properties of the fault itself.

```
class FaultsObserver : IObserver
{
    public void OnNext(T Event)
    {
        // Cast
        CimSubscriptionResult SubscriptionResult = Event as CimSubscriptionResult;

        if (SubscriptionResult != null)
        {
            // Unpack
            CimKeyedCollection<CimProperty> Properties = SubscriptionResult.Instance.CimInstanceProperties;
            String ChangeType = Properties["ChangeType"].Value.ToString();
            String FaultId = Properties["FaultId"].Value.ToString();

            // Create
            if (ChangeType == "0")
            {
                Fault MyNewFault = new MyFault(SubscriptionResult.Instance);
                // TODO: Whatever you want!
            }
            // Remove
            if (ChangeType == "1")
            {
                // TODO: Use FaultId to find and delete whatever representation you have...
            }
            // Update
            if (ChangeType == "2")
            {
                // TODO: Use FaultId to find and modify whatever representation you have...
            }
        }
    }
    public void OnError(Exception e)
    {
        // Handle Exceptions
    }
    public void OnCompleted()
    {
        // Nothing
    }
}
```

### Understand fault lifecycle

Faults are not intended to be marked "seen" or resolved by the user. They are created when the Health Service observes a problem, and they are removed automatically and only when the Health Service can no longer observe the problem. In general, this reflects that the problem has been fixed.

However, in some cases, faults may be rediscovered by the Health Service (e.g. after failover, or due to intermittent connectivity, etc.). For this reason, it may makes sense to persist your own representation of faults, so you can easily deduplicate. This is especially important if you send email alerts or equivalent.

>[!NOTE]
> The health of storage enclosure components such as fans, power supplies, and sensors is derived from SCSI Enclosure Services (SES). If your vendor does not provide this information, the Health Service cannot display it.
