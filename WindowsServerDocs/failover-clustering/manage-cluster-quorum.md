# Configure and manage quorum

> Applies to: Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2; Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

This topic provides background and steps to configure and manage the quorum in a Windows Server failover cluster.

## Understanding quorum

The quorum for a cluster is determined by the number of voting elements that must be part of active cluster membership for that cluster to start properly or continue running. For a more detailed explanation, see the [understanding cluster and pool quorum doc](../storage/storage-spaces/understand-quorum.md).

## Quorum configuration options

The quorum model in Windows Server is flexible. If you need to modify the quorum configuration for your cluster, you can use the Configure Cluster Quorum Wizard or the FailoverClusters Windows PowerShell cmdlets. For steps and considerations to configure the quorum, see [Configure the cluster quorum](#configure-the-cluster-quorum) later in this topic.

The following table lists the three quorum configuration options that are available in the Configure Cluster Quorum Wizard.

| Option  |Description  |
| --------- | ---------|
| Use typical settings     |  The cluster automatically assigns a vote to each node and dynamically manages the node votes. If it is suitable for your cluster, and there is cluster shared storage available, the cluster selects a disk witness. This option is recommended in most cases, because the cluster software automatically chooses a quorum and witness configuration that provides the highest availability for your cluster.       |
| Add or change the quorum witness     |   You can add, change, or remove a witness resource. You can configure a file share or disk witness. The cluster automatically assigns a vote to each node and dynamically manages the node votes.      |
| Advanced quorum configuration and witness selection     | You should select this option only when you have application-specific or site-specific requirements for configuring the quorum. You can modify the quorum witness, add or remove node votes, and choose whether the cluster dynamically manages node votes. By default, votes are assigned to all nodes, and the node votes are dynamically managed.        |

Depending on the quorum configuration option that you choose and your specific settings, the cluster will be configured in one of the following quorum modes:

| Mode  | Description  |
| --------- | ---------|
| Node majority (no witness)     |   Only nodes have votes. No quorum witness is configured. The cluster quorum is the majority of voting nodes in the active cluster membership.      |
| Node majority with witness (disk or file share)     |   Nodes have votes. In addition, a quorum witness has a vote. The cluster quorum is the majority of voting nodes in the active cluster membership plus a witness vote. A quorum witness can be a designated disk witness or a designated file share witness.
| No majority (disk witness only)     | No nodes have votes. Only a disk witness has a vote. <br>The cluster quorum is determined by the state of the disk witness. Generally, this mode is not recommended, and it should not be selected because it creates a single point of failure for the cluster.       |

The following subsections will give you more information about advanced quorum configuration settings.

### Witness configuration

As a general rule when you configure a quorum, the voting elements in the cluster should be an odd number. Therefore, if the cluster contains an even number of voting nodes, you should configure a disk witness or a file share witness. The cluster will be able to sustain one additional node down. In addition, adding a witness vote enables the cluster to continue running if half the cluster nodes simultaneously go down or are disconnected.

A disk witness is usually recommended if all nodes can see the disk. A file share witness is recommended when you need to consider multisite disaster recovery with replicated storage. Configuring a disk witness with replicated storage is possible only if the storage vendor supports read-write access from all sites to the replicated storage. <strong>*A Disk Witness isn't supported with Storage Spaces Direct*</strong>.

The following table provides additional information and considerations about the quorum witness types.

| Witness type  | Description  | Requirements and recommendations  |
| ---------    |---------        |---------                        |
| Disk witness     |  <ul><li> Dedicated LUN that stores a copy of the cluster database</li><li> Most useful for clusters with shared (not replicated) storage</li>       |  <ul><li>Size of LUN must be at least 512 MB</li><li> Must be dedicated to cluster use and not assigned to a clustered role</li><li> Must be included in clustered storage and pass storage validation tests</li><li> Cannot be a disk that is a Cluster Shared Volume (CSV)</li><li> Basic disk with a single volume</li><li> Does not need to have a drive letter</li><li> Can be formatted with NTFS or ReFS</li><li> Can be optionally configured with hardware RAID for fault tolerance</li><li> Should be excluded from backups and antivirus scanning</li><li> A Disk witness isn't supported with Storage Spaces Direct</li>|
| File share witness     | <ul><li>SMB file share that is configured on a file server running Windows Server</li><li> Does not store a copy of the cluster database</li><li> Maintains cluster information only in a witness.log file</li><li> Most useful for multisite clusters with replicated storage </li>       |  <ul><li>Must have a minimum of 5 MB of free space</li><li> Must be dedicated to the single cluster and not used to store user or application data</li><li> Must have write permissions enabled for the computer object for the cluster name</li></ul><br>The following are additional considerations for a file server that hosts the file share witness:<ul><li>A single file server can be configured with file share witnesses for multiple clusters.</li><li> The file server must be on a site that is separate from the cluster workload. This allows equal opportunity for any cluster site to survive if site-to-site network communication is lost. If the file server is on the same site, that site becomes the primary site, and it is the only site that can reach the file share.</li><li> The file server can run on a virtual machine if the virtual machine is not hosted on the same cluster that uses the file share witness.</li><li> For high availability, the file server can be configured on a separate failover cluster. </li>      |
| Cloud witness     |  <ul><li>A witness file stored in Azure Blob Storage</li><li> Recommended when all servers in the cluster have a reliable Internet connection.</li>      |  See [Deploy a cloud witness](./deploy-cloud-witness.md).       |

### Node vote assignment

As an advanced quorum configuration option, you can choose to assign or remove quorum votes on a per-node basis. By default, all nodes are assigned votes. Regardless of vote assignment, all nodes continue to function in the cluster, receive cluster database updates, and can host applications.

You might want to remove votes from nodes in certain disaster recovery configurations. For example, in a multisite cluster, you could remove votes from the nodes in a backup site so that those nodes do not affect quorum calculations. This configuration is recommended only for manual failover across sites. For more information, see [Quorum considerations for disaster recovery configurations](#quorum-considerations-for-disaster-recovery-configurations) later in this topic.

The configured vote of a node can be verified by looking up the **NodeWeight** common property of the cluster node by using the [Get-ClusterNode](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh847268.aspx) Windows PowerShell cmdlet. A value of 0 indicates that the node does not have a quorum vote configured. A value of 1 indicates that the quorum vote of the node is assigned, and it is managed by the cluster. For more information about management of node votes, see [Dynamic quorum management](#dynamic-quorum-management) later in this topic.

The vote assignment for all cluster nodes can be verified by using the **Validate Cluster Quorum** validation test.

#### Additional considerations for node vote assignment

  - Node vote assignment is not recommended to enforce an odd number of voting nodes. Instead, you should configure a disk witness or file share witness. For more information, see [Witness configuration](#witness-configuration) later in this topic.
  - If dynamic quorum management is enabled, only the nodes that are configured to have node votes assigned can have their votes assigned or removed dynamically. For more information, see [Dynamic quorum management](#dynamic-quorum-management) later in this topic.

### Dynamic quorum management

In Windows Server 2012, as an advanced quorum configuration option, you can choose to enable dynamic quorum management by cluster. For more details on how dynamic quorum works, see [this explanation](../storage/storage-spaces/understand-quorum.md#dynamic-quorum-behavior).

With dynamic quorum management, it is also possible for a cluster to run on the last surviving cluster node. By dynamically adjusting the quorum majority requirement, the cluster can sustain sequential node shutdowns to a single node.

The cluster-assigned dynamic vote of a node can be verified with the **DynamicWeight** common property of the cluster node by using the [Get-ClusterNode](/powershell/module/failoverclusters/get-clusternode) Windows PowerShell cmdlet. A value of 0 indicates that the node does not have a quorum vote. A value of 1 indicates that the node has a quorum vote.

The vote assignment for all cluster nodes can be verified by using the **Validate Cluster Quorum** validation test.

#### Additional considerations for dynamic quorum management

- Dynamic quorum management does not allow the cluster to sustain a simultaneous failure of a majority of voting members. To continue running, the cluster must always have a quorum majority at the time of a node shutdown or failure.

- If you have explicitly removed the vote of a node, the cluster cannot dynamically add or remove that vote.
- When Storage Spaces Direct is enabled, the cluster can only support two node failures. This is explained more in the [pool quorum section](../storage/storage-spaces/understand-quorum.md)

## General recommendations for quorum configuration

The cluster software automatically configures the quorum for a new cluster, based on the number of nodes configured and the availability of shared storage. This is usually the most appropriate quorum configuration for that cluster. However, it is a good idea to review the quorum configuration after the cluster is created, before placing the cluster into production. To view the detailed cluster quorum configuration, you can you use the Validate a Configuration Wizard, or the [Test-Cluster](/powershell/module/failoverclusters/test-cluster) Windows PowerShell cmdlet, to run the **Validate Quorum Configuration** test. In Failover Cluster Manager, the basic quorum configuration is displayed in the summary information for the selected cluster, or you can review the information about quorum resources that returns when you run the [Get-ClusterQuorum](/powershell/module/failoverclusters/get-clusterquorum) Windows PowerShell cmdlet.

At any time, you can run the **Validate Quorum Configuration** test to validate that the quorum configuration is optimal for your cluster. The test output indicates if a change to the quorum configuration is recommended and the settings that are optimal. If a change is recommended, you can use the Configure Cluster Quorum Wizard to apply the recommended settings.

After the cluster is in production, do not change the quorum configuration unless you have determined that the change is appropriate for your cluster. You might want to consider changing the quorum configuration in the following situations:

- Adding or evicting nodes
- Adding or removing storage
- A long-term node or witness failure
- Recovering a cluster in a multisite disaster recovery scenario

For more information about validating a failover cluster, see [Validate Hardware for a Failover Cluster](</previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/jj134244(v%3dws.11)>).

## Configure the cluster quorum

You can configure the cluster quorum settings by using Failover Cluster Manager or the FailoverClusters Windows PowerShell cmdlets.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is usually best to use the quorum configuration that is recommended by the Configure Cluster Quorum Wizard. We recommend customizing the quorum configuration only if you have determined that the change is appropriate for your cluster. For more information, see [General recommendations for quorum configuration](#general-recommendations-for-quorum-configuration) in this topic.

### Configure the cluster quorum settings

Membership in the local **Administrators** group on each clustered server, or equivalent, is the minimum permissions required to complete this procedure. Also, the account you use must be a domain user account.

> [!NOTE]
> You can change the cluster quorum configuration without stopping the cluster or taking cluster resources offline.

### Change the quorum configuration in a failover cluster by using Failover Cluster Manager

1. In Failover Cluster Manager, select or specify the cluster that you want to change.
2. With the cluster selected, under **Actions**, select **More Actions**, and then select **Configure Cluster Quorum Settings**. The Configure Cluster Quorum Wizard appears. Select **Next**.
3. On the **Select Quorum Configuration Option** page, select one of the three configuration options and complete the steps for that option. Before you configure the quorum settings, you can review your choices. For more information about the options, see [Understanding quorum](#understanding-quorum), earlier in this topic.

    - To allow the cluster to automatically reset the quorum settings that are optimal for your current cluster configuration, select **Use default quorum configuration** and then complete the wizard.
    - To add or change the quorum witness, select **Select the quorum witness**, and then complete the following steps. For information and considerations about configuring a quorum witness, see [Witness configuration](#witness-configuration) earlier in this topic.

      1. On the **Select Quorum Witness** page, select an option to configure a disk witness or a file share witness. The wizard indicates the witness selection options that are recommended for your cluster.

          > [!NOTE]
          > You can also select **Do not configure a quorum witness** and then complete the wizard. If you have an even number of voting nodes in your cluster, this may not be a recommended configuration.

      2. If you select the option to configure a disk witness, on the **Configure Storage Witness** page, select the storage volume that you want to assign as the disk witness, and then complete the wizard.
      3. If you select the option to configure a file share witness, on the **Configure File Share Witness** page, type or browse to a file share that will be used as the witness resource, and then complete the wizard.
      4. If you select the option to configure a cloud witness, on the **Configure Cloud Witness** page, enter your Azure storage account name, Azure storage account key and the Azure service endpoint, and then complete the wizard.
          > [!NOTE]
          > This option is available in Windows Server 2016 and above.

    - To configure quorum management settings and to add or change the quorum witness, select **Advanced quorum configuration**, and then complete the following steps. For information and considerations about the advanced quorum configuration settings, see [Node vote assignment](#node-vote-assignment) and [Dynamic quorum management](#dynamic-quorum-management) earlier in this topic.

      1. On the **Select Voting Configuration** page, select an option to assign votes to nodes. By default, all nodes are assigned a vote. However, for certain scenarios, you can assign votes only to a subset of the nodes.

          > [!NOTE]
          > You can also select **No Nodes**. This is generally not recommended, because it does not allow nodes to participate in quorum voting, and it requires configuring a disk witness. This disk witness becomes the single point of failure for the cluster.

      2. On the **Configure Quorum Management** page, you can enable or disable the **Allow cluster to dynamically manage the assignment of node votes** option. Selecting this option generally increases the availability of the cluster. By default the option is enabled, and it is strongly recommended to not disable this option. This option allows the cluster to continue running in failure scenarios that are not possible when this option is disabled.
          > [!NOTE]
          > This option is not present in Windows Server 2016 and above.
          
      3. On the **Select Quorum Witness** page, select an option to configure a disk witness, file share witness or a cloud witness. The wizard indicates the witness selection options that are recommended for your cluster.

          > [!NOTE]
          > You can also select **Do not configure a quorum witness**, and then complete the wizard. If you have an even number of voting nodes in your cluster, this may not be a recommended configuration.

      4. If you select the option to configure a disk witness, on the **Configure Storage Witness** page, select the storage volume that you want to assign as the disk witness, and then complete the wizard.
      5. If you select the option to configure a file share witness, on the **Configure File Share Witness** page, type or browse to a file share that will be used as the witness resource, and then complete the wizard.
      6. If you select the option to configure a cloud witness, on the **Configure Cloud Witness** page, enter your Azure storage account name, Azure storage account key and the Azure service endpoint, and then complete the wizard.
          > [!NOTE]
          > This option is available in Windows Server 2016 and above.

4. Select **Next**. Confirm your selections on the confirmation page that appears, and then select **Next**.

After the wizard runs and the **Summary** page appears, if you want to view a report of the tasks that the wizard performed, select **View Report**. The most recent report will remain in the <em>systemroot</em>**\\Cluster\\Reports** folder with the name **QuorumConfiguration.mht**.

> [!NOTE]
> After you configure the cluster quorum, we recommend that you run the **Validate Quorum Configuration** test to verify the updated quorum settings.

### Windows PowerShell equivalent commands

The following examples show how to use the [Set-ClusterQuorum](/powershell/module/failoverclusters/set-clusterquorum) cmdlet and other Windows PowerShell cmdlets to configure the cluster quorum.

The following example changes the quorum configuration on cluster *CONTOSO-FC1* to a simple node majority configuration with no quorum witness.

```PowerShell
Set-ClusterQuorum –Cluster CONTOSO-FC1 -NodeMajority
```

The following example changes the quorum configuration on the local cluster to a node majority with witness configuration. The disk resource named *Cluster Disk 2* is configured as a disk witness.

```PowerShell
Set-ClusterQuorum -NodeAndDiskMajority "Cluster Disk 2"
```

The following example changes the quorum configuration on the local cluster to a node majority with witness configuration. The file share resource named *\\\\CONTOSO-FS\\fsw* is configured as a file share witness.

```PowerShell
Set-ClusterQuorum -NodeAndFileShareMajority "\\fileserver\fsw"
```

The following example removes the quorum vote from node *ContosoFCNode1* on the local cluster.

```PowerShell
(Get-ClusterNode ContosoFCNode1).NodeWeight=0
```

The following example adds the quorum vote to node *ContosoFCNode1* on the local cluster.

```PowerShell
(Get-ClusterNode ContosoFCNode1).NodeWeight=1
```

The following example enables the **DynamicQuorum** property of the cluster *CONTOSO-FC1* (if it was previously disabled):

```PowerShell
(Get-Cluster CONTOSO-FC1).DynamicQuorum=1
```

## Recover a cluster by starting without quorum

A cluster that does not have enough quorum votes will not start. As a first step, you should always confirm the cluster quorum configuration and investigate why the cluster no longer has quorum. This might happen if you have nodes that stopped responding, or if the primary site is not reachable in a multisite cluster. After you identify the root cause for the cluster failure, you can use the recovery steps described in this section.

> [!NOTE]
> * If the Cluster service stops because quorum is lost, Event ID 1177 appears in the system log.
> * It is always necessary to investigate why the cluster quorum was lost.
> * It is always preferable to bring a node or quorum witness to a healthy state (join the cluster) rather than starting the cluster without quorum.

### Force start cluster nodes

After you determine that you cannot recover your cluster by bringing the nodes or quorum witness to a healthy state, forcing your cluster to start becomes necessary. Forcing the cluster to start overrides your cluster quorum configuration settings and starts the cluster in **ForceQuorum** mode.

Forcing a cluster to start when it does not have quorum may be especially useful in a multisite cluster. Consider a disaster recovery scenario with a cluster that contains separately located primary and backup sites, *SiteA* and *SiteB*. If there is a genuine disaster at *SiteA*, it could take a significant amount of time for the site to come back online. You would likely want to force *SiteB* to come online, even though it does not have quorum.

When a cluster is started in **ForceQuorum** mode, and after it regains sufficient quorum votes, the cluster automatically leaves the forced state, and it behaves normally. Hence, it is not necessary to start the cluster again normally. If the cluster loses a node and it loses quorum, it goes offline again because it is no longer in the forced state. To bring it back online when it does not have quorum requires forcing the cluster to start without quorum.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * After a cluster is force started, the administrator is in full control of the cluster.
> * The cluster uses the cluster configuration on the node where the cluster is force started, and replicates it to all other nodes that are available.
> * If you force the cluster to start without quorum, all quorum configuration settings are ignored while the cluster remains in **ForceQuorum** mode. This includes specific node vote assignments and dynamic quorum management settings.

### Prevent quorum on remaining cluster nodes

After you have force started the cluster on a node, it is necessary to start any remaining nodes in your cluster with a setting to prevent quorum. A node started with a setting that prevents quorum indicates to the Cluster service to join an existing running cluster instead of forming a new cluster instance. This prevents the remaining nodes from forming a split cluster that contains two competing instances.

This becomes necessary when you need to recover your cluster in some multisite disaster recovery scenarios after you have force started the cluster on your backup site, *SiteB*. To join the force started cluster in *SiteB*, the nodes in your primary site, *SiteA*, need to be started with the quorum prevented.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After a cluster is force started on a node, we recommend that you always start the remaining nodes with the quorum prevented.

Here's how to recover the cluster with Failover Cluster Manager:

1. In Failover Cluster Manager, select or specify the cluster you want to recover.
2. With the cluster selected, under **Actions**, select **Force Cluster Start**.

    Failover Cluster Manager force starts the cluster on all nodes that are reachable. The cluster uses the current cluster configuration when starting.

> [!NOTE]
> * To force the cluster to start on a specific node that contains a cluster configuration that you want to use, you must use the Windows PowerShell cmdlets or equivalent command-line tools as presented after this procedure.
> * If you use Failover Cluster Manager to connect to a cluster that is force started, and you use the **Start Cluster Service** action to start a node, the node is automatically started with the setting that prevents quorum.

#### Windows PowerShell equivalent commands (Start-Clusternode)

The following example shows how to use the **Start-ClusterNode** cmdlet to force start the cluster on node *ContosoFCNode1*.

```PowerShell
Start-ClusterNode –Node ContosoFCNode1 –FQ
```

Alternatively, you can type the following command locally on the node:

```PowerShell
Net Start ClusSvc /FQ
```

The following example shows how to use the **Start-ClusterNode** cmdlet to start the Cluster service with the quorum prevented on node *ContosoFCNode1*.

```PowerShell
Start-ClusterNode –Node ContosoFCNode1 –PQ
```

Alternatively, you can type the following command locally on the node:

```PowerShell
Net Start ClusSvc /PQ
```

## Quorum considerations for disaster recovery configurations

This section summarizes characteristics and quorum configurations for two multisite cluster configurations in disaster recovery deployments. The quorum configuration guidelines differ depending on if you need automatic failover or manual failover for workloads between the sites. Your configuration usually depends on the service level agreements (SLAs) that are in place in your organization to provide and support clustered workloads in the event of a failure or disaster at a site.

### Automatic failover

In this configuration, the cluster consists of two or more sites that can host clustered roles. If a failure occurs at any site, the clustered roles are expected to automatically fail over to the remaining sites. Therefore, the cluster quorum must be configured so that any site can sustain a complete site failure.

The following table summarizes considerations and recommendations for this configuration.

| Item  | Description  |
| ---------| ---------|
| Number of node votes per site     | Should be equal       |
| Node vote assignment     |  Node votes should not be removed because all nodes are equally important       |
| Dynamic quorum management     |   Should be enabled      |
| Witness configuration     |  File share witness is recommended, configured in a site that is separate from the cluster sites       |
| Workloads     |  Workloads can be configured on any of the sites       |

#### Additional considerations for automatic failover

- Configuring the file share witness in a separate site is necessary to give each site an equal opportunity to survive. For more information, see [Witness configuration](#witness-configuration) earlier in this topic.

### Manual failover

In this configuration, the cluster consists of a primary site, *SiteA*, and a backup (recovery) site, *SiteB*. Clustered roles are hosted on *SiteA*. Because of the cluster quorum configuration, if a failure occurs at all nodes in *SiteA*, the cluster stops functioning. In this scenario the administrator must manually fail over the cluster services to *SiteB* and perform additional steps to recover the cluster.

The following table summarizes considerations and recommendations for this configuration.

| Item   |Description  |
| ---------| ---------|
| Number of node votes per site     |  <ul><li> Node votes should not be removed from nodes at the primary site, **SiteA**</li><li>Node votes should be removed from nodes at the backup site, **SiteB**</li><li>If a long-term outage occurs at **SiteA**, votes must be assigned to nodes at **SiteB** to enable a quorum majority at that site as part of recovery</li>       |
| Dynamic quorum management     |  Should be enabled       |
| Witness configuration     |  <ul><li>Configure a witness if there is an even number of nodes at **SiteA**</li><li>If a witness is needed, configure either a file share witness or a disk witness that is accessible only to nodes in **SiteA** (sometimes called an asymmetric disk witness)</li>       |
| Workloads     |  Use preferred owners to keep workloads running on nodes at **SiteA**       |

#### Additional considerations for manual failover

- Only the nodes at *SiteA* are initially configured with quorum votes. This is necessary to ensure that the state of nodes at *SiteB* does not affect the cluster quorum.
- Recovery steps can vary depending on if *SiteA* sustains a temporary failure or a long-term failure.
