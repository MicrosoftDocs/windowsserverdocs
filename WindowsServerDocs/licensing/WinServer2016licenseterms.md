These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation \(or based on where you live, or if a business, where your principal place of business is located, one of its affiliates\) and you. If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of an entity, such as your employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity. Please read them. They apply to the pre\-release software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft:  

-   updates,  

-   supplements,  

-   Internet\-based services,  

-   support services  

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.  

**By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software.**  

**As described below, using some features also operates as your consent to automatic updates, the transmission of certain standard computer information for Internet\-based services.**  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.  

## 1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS  

-   You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your premises to design, develop and test your programs for use with the software. You may use as many copies of the software as the product key permits.  

-   You may not test the software in a live operating environment unless Microsoft permits you to do so under another agreement.  

-   The software may include tools and components to support new features of the operating system. You may not use or redistribute these tools or components for any purpose other than for use by those new features that are distributed as part of the operating system. For example, Service Fabric is a software component that may be used by the Network Controller feature of the operating system only.  

## 2. INTERNET\-BASED SERVICES; PRIVACY  
Microsoft provides Internet\-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.  

Consent for Internet\-Based Services. Because this software is a pre\-release version, we have turned on some internet\-based features by default to obtain feedback about them. The software features described below and in the Windows Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see [go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkId\=723606](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=723606). By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information to any country Microsoft operates in. The list below may not be fully\-inclusive.  

Computer Information. Some software features use Internet protocols, which send to Microsoft \(or its suppliers or service providers\) computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet\-based services available to you, in accordance with the Privacy Statement at [go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkId\=723606](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=723606).  

## 3. ACTIVATION  
Activation associates the use of the software with a specific device. During activation, the software will send information about the software and the device to Microsoft. This information includes the version, language and product key of the software, the Internet protocol address of the device, and information derived from the hardware configuration of the device. For more information, see [go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkId\=39157](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=39157). By using the software, you consent to the transmission of this information. If properly licensed, you have the right to use the version of the software installed during the installation process up to the time permitted for activation. Unless the software is activated, you have no right to use the software after the time permitted for activation. This is to prevent its unlicensed use. You are not permitted to bypass or circumvent activation. If the device is connected to the Internet, the software may automatically connect to Microsoft for activation. You can also activate the software manually by Internet or telephone. If you do so, Internet and telephone service charges may apply. Some changes to your computer components or the software may require you to reactivate the software. The software will remind you to activate it until you do.  

## 4. TIME\-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE  
The software will stop running on a predetermined date. You will not receive any other notice. You may not be able to access data used with the software when it stops running. Please see [go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkId\=624232](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=624232) for specific information about the end date for the software.  

## 5. PRODUCT KEYS  
The software may require a key to install or access it. If it does, you are responsible for the use of keys assigned to you. You should not share the keys with third parties.  

## 6. PRE\-RELEASE SOFTWARE  
This software is a pre\-release version. It may not work the way a final version of the software will. We may change it for the final, commercial version. We also may not release a commercial version.  

## 7. FEEDBACK  
If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.

## 13. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS

These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see [microsoft.com\/exporting](https://www.microsoft.com/exporting).  

## 14. SUPPORT SERVICES  
Because this software is "as is," we may not provide support services for it.  

## 15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT  
This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet\-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.  

## 16. APPLICABLE LAW  
United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.  

Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.  

## 17. LEGAL EFFECT  
This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.  

## 18. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY  
The software is licensed "as\-is." You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights or statutory guarantees under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non\-infringement.  

**For Australia only** " You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in these terms is intended to affect those rights.  

## 19. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES  
You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to $5.00 USD. **You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.**  

This limitation applies to:  

-   anything related to the software, services, content \(including code\) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and  

-   claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.  

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages. **If your local law allows you to recover other damages from Microsoft even though we do not, you cannot recover more than $5.00 USD, or the amount you paid for the software, whichever is higher.**
