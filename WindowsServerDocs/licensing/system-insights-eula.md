# MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

## MICROSOFT.WINDOWSSERVER.SYSTEMINSIGHTS

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on
where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. They apply to the software named
above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the
software, except to the extent those have different terms.

---------------
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
    
    You may install and use any number of copies of the software to develop and test
libraries for use with Windows Server.

2. TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE.

    a.  Period. This agreement is effective on your acceptance and terminates on the
        earlier of (i) 30 days following first availability of a commercial release
        of the software or (ii) upon termination by Microsoft. Microsoft may extend
        this agreement in its discretion.
    
    b.  Notice. You may receive periodic reminder notices of this date through the
        software.
    
    c.  Access to data. You may not be able to access data used in the software when
        it stops running.
    
3. PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. The software is a pre-release version. It may not operate correctly. It may be different from the commercially released version.
1. FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.
1. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not

    -   work around any technical limitations in the software;
    
    -   reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise
        attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent
        required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source
        components that may be included in the software;
    
    -   remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers
        in the software;
    
    -   use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or
        propagate malware; or
    
    -   share, publish, rent or lease the software, provide the software as a
        stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this
        agreement to any third party.

6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.
1. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.
1. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
1. APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.
1. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

    a.  **Australia**. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law
        and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
    
    b.  **Canada**. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
        updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your
        device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
        however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or
        uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also
        specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
    
    c.  **Germany and Austria**.
    
    **(i) Warranty**. The software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.
    
    **(ii) Limitation of Liability**. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.
    
    Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence

11. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.**
1. **LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. \$5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.**

    This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

**Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the
clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.**

clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.**

quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril.
Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de
droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs,
que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale,
les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage
particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.

**LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES
DOMMAGES.** Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une
indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 \$ US.

titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la
limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître
l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la
limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de
quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion
ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.

**EFFET JURIDIQUE.** Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous
pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent
contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si
celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
