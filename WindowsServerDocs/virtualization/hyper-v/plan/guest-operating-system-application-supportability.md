# Guest operating system and application supportability on Hyper-V

Hyper-V is a hypervisor that is broadly used in many Microsoft server products, including the Windows Server family (Datacenter, Standard, and Essentials editions) and Azure Stack HCI. Hyper-V provides a platform with broad ecosystem support and compatibility. This article clarifies which versions of Windows Server or Azure Stack HCI map to which Hyper-V build numbers. This helps understand supported scenarios where a guest operating system or application has been validated for Hyper-V.

Although the different products that include Hyper-V could contain variations in features, the common codebase provides a consistent platform for guest operating systems and applications running inside of a virtual machine to run on compatible products that share the same Hyper-V build number. This means that any support or compatibility statements for a guest operating system or application that is certified for specific builds of Hyper-V is compatible with all products that share the same build number for Hyper-V.

The table below shows which Hyper-V build numbers are available in which compatible products:

| Hyper-V build | Compatible products |
|--|--|
| 20348 | Windows Server 2022 Datacenter<br />Windows Server 2022 Standard<br />Windows Server 2022 Essentials<br />Azure Stack HCI version 21H2 <br />Azure Stack HCI version 22H2|
| 17763 and 17784 | Windows Server 2019 Datacenter<br />Windows Server 2019 Standard<br />Windows Server 2019 Essentials<br />Hyper-V Server 2019<br />Azure Stack HCI version 20H2|
| 14393 | Windows Server 2016 Datacenter<br />Windows Server 2016 Standard<br />Windows Server 2016 Essentials<br />Hyper-V Server 2016 |
