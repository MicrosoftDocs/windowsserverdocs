# Hyper-V feature compatibility by generation and guest

>Applies To: Windows Server 2016

The tables in this article show you the generations and operating systems that are compatible with some of the Hyper-V features, grouped by categories. In general, you'll get the best availability of features with a generation 2 virtual machine that runs the newest operating system.

Keep in mind that some features rely on hardware or other infrastructure. For hardware details, see [System requirements for Hyper-V on Windows Server 2016](System-requirements-for-Hyper-V-on-Windows.md). In some cases, a feature can be used with any supported guest operating system. For details on which operating systems are supported, see:

* [Supported Linux and FreeBSD virtual machines](Supported-Linux-and-FreeBSD-virtual-machines-for-Hyper-V-on-Windows.md)
* [Supported Windows guest operating systems](Supported-Windows-guest-operating-systems-for-Hyper-V-on-Windows.md)
