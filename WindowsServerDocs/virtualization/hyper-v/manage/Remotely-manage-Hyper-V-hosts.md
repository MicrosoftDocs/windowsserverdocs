# Remotely manage Hyper-V hosts with Hyper-V Manager

This article lists the supported combinations of Hyper-V hosts and Hyper-V Manager versions and describes how to connect to remote and local Hyper-V hosts so you can manage them.

Hyper-V Manager lets you manage a small number of Hyper-V hosts, both remote and local. It's installed when you install the Hyper-V Management Tools, which you can do either through a full Hyper-V installation or a tools-only installation. Doing a tools-only installation means you can use the tools on computers that don't meet the hardware requirements to host Hyper-V. For details about hardware for Hyper-V hosts, see [System requirements](../System-requirements-for-Hyper-V-on-Windows.md). If Hyper-V Manager isn't installed, follow the [instructions to Install Hyper-V Manager](#install-hyper-v-manager).

## Connect to a Hyper-V host

To connect to a Hyper-V host from Hyper-V Manager, right-click **Hyper-V Manager** in the left pane, and then click **Connect to Server**.

## Manage Hyper-V on a local computer

Hyper-V Manager doesn't list any computers that host Hyper-V until you add the computer, including a local computer. To do this:

1. In the left pane, right-click **Hyper-V Manager**.
2. Click **Connect to Server**.
3. From **Select Computer**, click **Local computer** and then click **OK**.

If you can't connect:

* It's possible that only the Hyper-V tools are installed. To check that Hyper-V platform is installed, look for the Virtual Machine Management service. To do so: Open the Services desktop app: click **Start**, click the **Start Search** box, type **services.msc**, and then press **Enter**. If the Virtual Machine Management service isn't listed, install the Hyper-V platform by following the instructions in [Install Hyper-V](../get-started/Install-the-Hyper-V-role-on-Windows-Server.md).
* Check that your hardware meets the requirements. See [System requirements](../System-requirements-for-Hyper-V-on-Windows.md).
* Check that your user account belongs to the Administrators group or the Hyper-V Administrators group.

## Manage Hyper-V hosts remotely

To manage remote Hyper-V hosts, enable remote management on both the local computer and remote host.

On Windows Server, open Server Manager \>**Local Server** \>**Remote management** and then click **Allow remote connections to this computer**.

Or, from either operating system, open Windows PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```PowerShell
Enable-PSRemoting
```

### Connect to hosts in the same domain

To add a remote Hyper-V host to Hyper-V Manager, select **Another computer** in the **Select Computer** dialogue box and type the remote host's hostname, NetBIOS name, or fully qualified domain name \(FQDN\).

Hyper-V Manager offers more types of remote connections, which are described in the following sections.

### Connect to a remote host as a different user

This lets you connect to the Hyper-V host when you're not running on the local computer as a user that's a member of either the Hyper-V Administrators group or the Administrators group on the Hyper-V host. To do this:

1. In the left pane, right-click **Hyper-V Manager**.
1. Click **Connect to Server**.
1. Select **Connect as another user** in the **Select Computer** dialogue box.
1. Select **Set User**.

### Connect to a  remote host using IP address

To do this:

1. In the left pane, right-click **Hyper-V Manager**.
1. Click **Connect to Server**.
1. Type the IP address into the **Another Computer** text field.

### Connect to a remote host outside your domain, or with no domain

To do this:

1. On the Hyper-V host to be managed, open a Windows PowerShell session as Administrator.

1. Create the necessary firewall rules for private network zones:

   ```PowerShell
   Enable-PSRemoting
   ```

1. To allow remote access on public zones, enable firewall rules for CredSSP and WinRM:

   ```PowerShell
   Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role server
   ```

    For details, see [Enable-PSRemoting](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/enable-psremoting) and [Enable-WSManCredSSP](/powershell/module/microsoft.wsman.management/enable-wsmancredssp).

Next, configure the computer you'll use to manage the Hyper-V host.

1. Open a Windows PowerShell session as Administrator.
1. Run these commands:

    ```PowerShell
    Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value "fqdn-of-hyper-v-host"
    ```

    ```PowerShell
    Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role client -DelegateComputer "fqdn-of-hyper-v-host"
    ```

1. You might also need to configure the following group policy:
    * **Computer Configuration** \> **Administrative Templates** \> **System** \> **Credentials Delegation** \> **Allow delegating fresh credentials with NTLM-only server authentication**
    * Select **Enable** and add *wsman/fqdn-of-hyper-v-host*.
1. Open **Hyper-V Manager**.
1. In the left pane, right-click **Hyper-V Manager**.
1. Select **Connect to Server**.

For cmdlet details, see [Set-Item](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/set-item) and [Enable-WSManCredSSP](/powershell/module/microsoft.wsman.management/enable-wsmancredssp).

## Install Hyper-V Manager

To use a UI tool, choose the one appropriate for the operating system on the computer where you'll run Hyper-V Manager:

On Windows Server, open Server Manager \> **Manage** \> **Add roles and features**. Move to the **Features** page and expand **Remote server administration tools** \> **Role administration tools** \> **Hyper-V management tools**.

On Windows, Hyper-V Manager is available on [any Windows operating system that includes Hyper-V](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/hyper-v-requirements).

1. On the Windows desktop, select the Start button and begin typing **Programs and features**.
1. In search results, select **Programs and Features**.
1. In the left pane, select **Turn Windows features on or off**.
1. Expand the Hyper-V folder, and select **Hyper-V Management Tools**.
1. To install Hyper-V Manager, select **Hyper-V Management Tools**. If you want to also install the Hyper-V module, select that option.

To use Windows PowerShell, run the following command as Administrator:

```PowerShell
add-windowsfeature rsat-hyper-v-tools
```
