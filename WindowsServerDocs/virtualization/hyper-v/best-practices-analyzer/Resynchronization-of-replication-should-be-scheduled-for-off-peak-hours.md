In the following sections, italics indicates UI text that appears in the Best Practices Analyzer tool for this issue.

## Issue
*Resynchronization of replication for the primary virtual machines is not scheduled for off-peak hours.*

## Impact
*The longer a virtual machine is in a state requiring resynchronization, the longer the replication log files grow and the more unreplicated changes occur on the primary virtual machines. This impacts the following virtual machines:*

## Resolution
*Use Hyper-V Manager to modify the replication settings for the virtual machine to perform resynchronization automatically during off-peak hours.*
