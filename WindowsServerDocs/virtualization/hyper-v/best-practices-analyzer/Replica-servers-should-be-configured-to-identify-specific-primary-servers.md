In the following sections, italics indicates UI text that appears in the Best Practices Analyzer tool for this issue.

## Issue
*As configured, this Replica server accepts replication traffic from all primary servers and stores them in a single location.*

### Impact
*All replication from all primary servers is stored in one location, which might introduce privacy or security problems.*

## Resolution
*Use Hyper-V Manager to create new authorization entries for the specific primary servers and specify separate storage locations for each of them. You can use wildcard characters to group primary servers into sets for each authorization entry.*

#### Create authorization entries using Hyper-V Manager

1.  Open Hyper-V Manager. (From Server Manager, click **Tools** > **Hyper-V Manager**.)

2.  From the list of hosts, right-click the one you want, then click **Hyper-V Settings**.

3.  In the navigation pane, click **Replication Configuration**.

4.  Under **Authorization and storage**, click **Allow replication from the specified servers**.

5.  Below the list of servers, click **Add**.

6.  Under **Add Authorization Entry**:

    -   Type the fully qualified name of the first server.

    -   Specify a dedicated location to store only that server's files.

7.  Click **OK**.

8.  Repeat for each primary server.

9. Click **OK** again to finish and close the window.

### Create authorization entries using Windows PowerShell

1.  Open Windows PowerShell. (From the desktop, click Start and start typing **Windows PowerShell**.)

2.  Right-click **Windows PowerShell** and click **Run as administrator**.

3.  Run a command similar to the following, replacing:

    -   The primary server name of server01.domain01.contoso.com with the fully qualified domain name of your server.

    -   The location of D:\ReplicaVMStorage with your location.

    -   The trust group named DEFAULT with name of your group, if you've created one. If not, use DEFAULT.

```
New-VMReplicationAuthorizationEntry server01.domain01.contoso.com D:\ReplicaVMStorage DEFAULT
```
