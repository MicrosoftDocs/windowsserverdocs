## **Issue**
*A virtual machine running Windows 8.1 is configured with less than the recommended amount of RAM, which is 1 GB.*

## **Impact**
*The guest operating system and applications might not perform well. There might not be enough memory to run multiple applications at once. This impacts the following virtual machines:*
```
<list of virtual machines>
```
## **Resolution**
*Use Hyper-V Manager to increase the memory allocated to this virtual machine to at least 1 GB.*

#### Increase the memory using Hyper-V Manager

1.  Open Hyper-V Manager. Click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Hyper-V Manager**.

2.  In the results pane, under **Virtual Machines**, select the virtual machine that you want to configure. The state of the virtual machine should be listed as **Off**. If it is not, right-click the virtual machine and then click **Shut Down**.

3.  In the **Action** pane, under the virtual machine name, click **Settings**.

4.  In the navigation pane, click **Memory**.

5.  On the **Memory** page, set the **Startup RAM** to at least 1 GB and then click **OK**.

### Increase the memory using Windows PowerShell

1.  Open Windows PowerShell. (From the desktop, click **Start** and start typing **Windows PowerShell**.)

2.  Right-click **Windows PowerShell** and click **Run as administrator**.

3.  Run this command after replacing \<MyVM> with the name  of your virtual machine:

```
Set-VMMemory <MyVM> -StartupBytes 1GB
```
