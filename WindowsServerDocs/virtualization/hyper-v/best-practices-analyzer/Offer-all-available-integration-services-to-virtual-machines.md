\<list of virtual machine names>

## Resolution

*If this is intentional, no further action is required. Otherwise, consider offering all integration services in the settings of these virtual machines.*

The availability of some integration services can be managed through the virtual machine settings.

#### To manage the availability of integration services to a virtual machine

1.  Open Hyper-V Manager. Click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Hyper-V Manager**.

2.  In the results pane, under **Virtual Machines**, select the virtual machine that you want to configure.

3.  In the **Action** pane, under the virtual machine name, click **Settings**.

4.  Under **Management**, click **Integration Services**.

5.  In the list of integration services, select the check box for each service you want to offer to the virtual machine. If a check box is unavailable, that particular integration service is not supported by the guest operating system that runs in the virtual machine.
