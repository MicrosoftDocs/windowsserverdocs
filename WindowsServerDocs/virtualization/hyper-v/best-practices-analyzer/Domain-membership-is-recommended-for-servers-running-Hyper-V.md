## Issue

*This server is a member of a workgroup.*

## Impact

*There is no central management for this server.*

Joining this computer to the domain allows centralized management through policies for identity, security, and auditing.

## Resolution

*If you have a domain environment available, join this server to that domain.*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you review the workloads running in the virtual machines on this computer to determine whether there are security implications of joining this computer to a domain. If any of the virtual machines are virtualized domain controllers, see [Planning Considerations for Virtualized Domain Controllers](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd348476(v=ws.10)) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=190192).

Joining a computer to a domain requires permissions on the computer and the domain:
- On the computer, you'll need a user account that's a member of the Administrators group. Either log on with this type of account, or provide the user name and password for the account when you're prompted.
- On the domain, you'll need a user account that's authorized to join the computer to the domain. You'll be prompted for the user name and password.

For instructions, see [Join the Computer to the Domain](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd894430(v=ws.10)) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=190193).
