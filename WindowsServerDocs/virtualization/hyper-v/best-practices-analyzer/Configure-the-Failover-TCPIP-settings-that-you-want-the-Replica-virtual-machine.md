In the following sections, italics indicates UI text that appears in the Best Practices Analyzer tool for this issue.

## Issue
*Replica virtual machines configured with a static IP address should be configured to use a different IP address from their primary virtual machine counterpart in the event of failover.*

## Impact
*Clients using the workload supported by the primary virtual machine might not be able to connect to the Replica virtual machine after a failover. Also, the primary virtual machine's original IP address will not be valid in the Replica virtual machine network topology. This impacts the following virtual machines:*

## Resolution
*Use Hyper-V Manager to configure the IP address that the Replica virtual machine should use in the event of failover.*
