In the following sections, italics indicates UI text that appears in the Best Practices Analyzer tool for this issue.

## **Issue**
*One or more virtual machines have the AllowReducedFcRedunancy property set in the virtualization WMI provider.*

## **Impact**
*Live migration of the following virtual machines might lead to data loss or interrupt I/O to storage:*

\<list of virtual machines>

## **Resolution**
*Consider clearing the AllowReducedFcRedundancy WMI property on the affected virtual machines. When this property is cleared, you can perform a live migration on virtual machines configured with virtual Fibre Channel adapters only when the number of paths to Fibre Channel on the destination is the same or more than the number of paths on the source. These checks help prevent loss of data or interruption of I/O to the storage.*
