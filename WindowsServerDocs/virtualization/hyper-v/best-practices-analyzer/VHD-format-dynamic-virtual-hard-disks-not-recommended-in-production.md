## **Issue**
*One or more virtual machines use VHD-format dynamically expanding virtual hard disks.*

## **Impact**
*VHD-format dynamic virtual hard disks could experience consistency issues if a power failure occurs. Consistency issues can happen if the physical disk performs an incomplete or incorrect update to a sector in a .vhd file that is being modified when a power failure occurs. This affects the following virtual machines:*

## **Resolution**
*Shut down the virtual machine and convert the VHD-format dynamic virtual hard disk to a VHDX-format virtual hard disk or to a fixed virtual hard disk. (The VHDX format has reliability mechanisms that help protect the disk from corruptions due to system power failures.) However, do not convert the virtual hard disk if it is likely to be attached to an earlier release of Windows at some point. Windows releases earlier than  Windows Server 2012  do not support the VHDX format.*
