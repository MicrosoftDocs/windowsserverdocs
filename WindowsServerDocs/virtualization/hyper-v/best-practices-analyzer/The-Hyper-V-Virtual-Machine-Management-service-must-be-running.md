In the following sections, italics indicates UI text that appears in the Best Practices Analyzer tool for this issue.

## Issue

*The service required to manage virtual machines is not running.*

## Impact

*No virtual machine management operations can be performed.*

Virtual machines that are running will continue to run. However, you won't be able to manage virtual machines, or create or delete them until the service is running.

## Resolution

*Use the Services snap-in or Sc config command-line tool to reconfigure the service to start automatically.*

> [!TIP]
> If you can't find the service in the desktop app or the command-line tool reports that the service doesn't exist, the Hyper-V Management tools probably aren't installed.
And if you are not able to see the Hyper-V MMC console from the Start menu, you should install the Hyper-V Management Tools.

To install the Hyper-V Management tools:
>
> - On Windows Server, open Server Manager and use the Add Roles and Features wizard. For more details, see [Install the Hyper-V role on Windows Server 2016](../get-started/Install-the-Hyper-V-role-on-Windows-Server.md).  You can also use PowerShell to install the tools (`Install-WindowsFeature -Name Hyper-V-Tools, Hyper-V-PowerShell`)
> - On Windows, from the Desktop, begin typing **programs**, click **Programs and Features** (Control panel) > **Turn Windows features on or off** > **Hyper-V** > **Hyper-V Management Tools**. Then, click **OK**.

### To reconfigure the service to start automatically using the Services desktop app

1.  Open the Services desktop app. (Click **Start**, click in the **Start Search** box, type **services.msc**, and then press ENTER.)

2.  In the details pane, right-click **Hyper-V Virtual Machine Management**, and then click **Properties**.

3.  On the **General** tab, in **Startup** type, click **Automatic**.

4.  To start the service, click **Start**.

### To reconfigure the service to start automatically using SC Config

1.  Open Windows PowerShell. (From the desktop, click **Start** and start typing **Windows PowerShell**.)

2.  Right-click **Windows PowerShell** and click **Run as administrator**.

3.  To reconfigure the service, type:

    ```
    sc config vmms start=auto
    ```

4.  To start the service, type:

    ```
    sc start vmms
    ```

If the service is already configured to start automatically and you just need to restart the service, you can do that from Hyper-V Manager, or from the sc start vmms command shown above.

#### To restart the service from Hyper-V Manager

1.  Open Hyper-V Manager. Click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Hyper-V Manager**.

2.  In the navigation pane, click the name of the server if it's not already selected.

3.  In the **Actions** pane, click **Start Service**.
