In the following sections, italics indicates UI text that appears in the Best Practices Analyzer tool for this issue.

## Issue

*One or more virtual network adapters associated with a physical network adapter are disabled in the management operating system.*

## Impact

*The configuration of this server is not optimal.*

The management operating system can't connect to a physical (external) network using one of the physical network adapters on this computer because it's associated with a disabled virtual network adapter.

## Resolution

*Use Network &  Internet Settings to enable the virtual network adapter. Or, use Virtual Switch Manager to reconfigure the external virtual switch so that it is not shared with the management operating system.*
