In the following sections, italics indicates UI text that appears in the Best Practices Analyzer tool for this issue.

## **Issue**
*One or more virtual machines lack a highly available connection to Fibre Channel-based storage because those virtual machines are configured with a virtual Fibre Channel adapter that is connected to only one host bus adapter (HBA).*

## **Impact**
*A failure of the host bus adapter might block the Fibre Channel connection between the storage and the virtual machines. This impacts the following virtual machines:*

\<list of virtual machines>

## **Resolution**
*Add another connection from the virtual machine to the host bus adapter and configure multipath I/O (MPIO) in the guest operating system to establish redundant Fibre Channel connections.*
