## Issue

*The Hyper-V Virtual Machine Management Service is not configured to start automatically.*

## Impact

*Virtual machines cannot be managed until the service is started.*

Virtual machines that are running will continue to run. However, you won't be able to manage virtual machines, or create or delete them until the service is running.

## Resolution

*Use the Services snap-in or sc config command-line tool to reconfigure the service to start automatically.*

> [!TIP]
> If you can't find the service in the desktop app or the command-line tool reports that the service doesn't exist, the Hyper-V Management tools probably aren't installed. To install them:
>
> - On Windows Server, open Server Manager and use the Add Roles and Features wizard. For more details, see [Install the Hyper-V role on Windows Server 2016](../get-started/Install-the-Hyper-V-role-on-Windows-Server.md).
> - On Windows, from the Desktop, begin typing **programs**, click **Programs and Features** (Control panel) > **Turn Windows features on or off** > **Hyper-V** > **Hyper-V Management Tools**. Then, click **OK**.
