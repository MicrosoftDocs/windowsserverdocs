In the following sections, italics indicates UI text that appears in the Best Practices Analyzer tool for this issue.

## **Issue**
*The server will accept replication requests for the replica virtual machine from any of the servers in the authorization list associated with the same replication tag as the virtual machine.*

## **Impact**
*There might be privacy and security concerns with a virtual machine accepting replication from primary servers belonging to different authorization entries. This impacts the following authorization entries: \<list of authorization entries>*

## **Resolution**
*Use different tags in the authorization entries for primary servers with virtual machines that are not part of the same security group. Modify the Hyper-V settings to configure the replication tags.*
