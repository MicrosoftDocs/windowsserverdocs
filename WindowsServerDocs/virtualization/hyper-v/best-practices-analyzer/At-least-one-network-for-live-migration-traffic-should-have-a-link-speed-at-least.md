In the following sections, italics indicates UI text that appears in the Best Practices Analyzer tool for this issue.

## Issue
*None of the networks for live migration traffic have a link speed of at least 1 Gbps.*

## Impact
*Live migrations might occur slowly, which could disrupt the network connection due to a TCP connection timeout.*

## Resolution
*Configure at least one live migration network with a speed of 1 Gbps or faster.*

See the documentation from your network hardware vendor to find out if any of your existing network adapters can support a link speed of at least 1 Gbps.
