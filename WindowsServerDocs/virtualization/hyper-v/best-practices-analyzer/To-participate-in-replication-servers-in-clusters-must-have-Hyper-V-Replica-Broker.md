In the following sections, italics indicates UI text that appears in the Best Practices Analyzer tool for this issue.

## Issue
*For failover clusters, Hyper-V Replica requires the use of a Hyper-V Replica Broker name instead of an individual server name.*

## Impact
*If the virtual machine is moved to a different failover cluster node, replication cannot continue.*

## Resolution
*Use Failover Cluster Manager to configure the Hyper-V Replica Broker. In Hyper-V Manager, ensure that the replication configuration uses the Hyper-V Replica Broker name as the server name.*
