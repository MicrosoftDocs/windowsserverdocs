\<list of virtual machine names>

The ability to hot plug or hot unplug storage makes it easier to manage the storage needs of a virtual machine without requiring downtime. Virtual machines without SCSI controllers must be shut down before you can add or remove storage.

## Resolution

*If you do not need to hot plug or hot unplug storage for this virtual machine, no action is required. Otherwise, shut down the virtual machine and add a SCSI controller to the configuration.*

To use a SCSI controller to hot plug and hot unplug storage, the guest operating system must be running the current version of integration services.
