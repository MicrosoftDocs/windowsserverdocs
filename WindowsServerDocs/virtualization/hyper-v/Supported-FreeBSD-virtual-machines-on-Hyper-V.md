## Notes

1. Suggest to [Label Disk Devices]( https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/geom-glabel.html) to avoid ROOT MOUNT ERROR during startup.

1. 9126 is the maximum supported MTU size.

1. In a failover scenario, you cannot set a static IPv6 address in the replica server. Use an IPv4 address instead.
