Supported CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines on Hyper-V
=========================================================================

>   Applies To: Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2; Windows Server 2019, Hyper-V Server 2019, Windows Server 2016,
>   Hyper-V Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Hyper-V Server 2012 R2, Windows
>   10, Windows 8.1

The following feature distribution maps indicate the features that are present
in built-in and downloadable versions of Linux Integration Services. The known
issues and workarounds for each distribution are listed after the tables.

The built-in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Integration Services drivers for Hyper-V
(available since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4) are sufficient for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux guests to run using the high performance synthetic devices on
Hyper-V hosts.These built-in drivers are certified by Red Hat for this use.
Certified configurations can be viewed on this Red Hat web page: [Red Hat
Certification
Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/ecosystem/search/#/ecosystem/Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux?sort=sortTitle%20asc&vendors=Microsoft&category=Server).
It isn't necessary to download and install Linux Integration Services packages
from the Microsoft Download Center, and doing so may limit your Red Hat support
as described in Red Hat Knowledgebase article 1067: [Red Hat Knowledgebase
1067](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1067).

Because of potential conflicts between the built-in LIS support and the
downloadable LIS support when you upgrade the kernel, disable automatic updates,
uninstall the LIS downloadable packages, update the kernel, reboot, and then
install the latest LIS release, and reboot again.

>   [!NOTE] Official Red Hat Enterprise Linux certification information is
>   available through the [Red Hat Customer
>   Portal](https://access.redhat.com/ecosystem/search/#/category/Server?sort=sortTitle%20asc&query=windows%20server&ecosystem=Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux).

Table legend
------------

-   **Built in** - LIS are included as part of this Linux distribution. The
    kernel module version numbers for the built in LIS (as shown by **lsmod**,
    for example) are different from the version number on the Microsoft-provided
    LIS download package. A mismatch does not indicate that the built in LIS is
    out of date.

-   ✔ - Feature available

Notes
-----

1.  For this RHEL/CentOS release, VLAN tagging works but VLAN trunking does not.

2.  Static IP injection may not work if Network Manager has been configured for
    a given synthetic network adapter on the virtual machine. For smooth
    functioning of static IP injection please make sure that either Network
    Manager is either turned off completely or has been turned off for a
    specific network adapter through its ifcfg-ethX file.

3.  On Windows Server 2012 R2 while using virtual fibre channel devices, make
    sure that logical unit number 0 (LUN 0) has been populated. If LUN 0 has not
    been populated, a Linux virtual machine might not be able to mount fibre
    channel devices natively.

4.  For built-in LIS, the "hyperv-daemons" package must be installed for this
    functionality.

5.  If there are open file handles during a live virtual machine backup
    operation, then in some corner cases, the backed-up VHDs might have to
    undergo a file system consistency check (fsck) on restore. Live backup
    operations can fail silently if the virtual machine has an attached iSCSI
    device or direct-attached storage (also known as a pass-through disk).

6.  While the Linux Integration Services download is preferred, live backup
    support for RHEL/CentOS 5.9 - 5.11/6.4/6.5 is also available through
    [Hyper-V Backup Essentials for
    Linux](https://github.com/LIS/backupessentials/tree/1.0).

7.  Dynamic memory support is only available on 64-bit virtual machines.

8.  Hot-Add support is not enabled by default in this distribution. To enable
    Hot-Add support you need to add a udev rule under /etc/udev/rules.d/ as
    follows:

9.  Create a file **/etc/udev/rules.d/100-balloon.rules**. You may use any other
    desired name for the file.

10. Add the following content to the file: `SUBSYSTEM=="memory", ACTION=="add",
    ATTR{state}="online"`

11. Reboot the system to enable Hot-Add support.

While the Linux Integration Services download creates this rule on installation,
the rule is also removed when LIS is uninstalled, so the rule must be recreated
if dynamic memory is needed after uninstallation.

1.  Dynamic memory operations can fail if the guest operating system is running
    too low on memory. The following are some best practices:

-   Startup memory and minimal memory should be equal to or greater than the
    amount of memory that the distribution vendor recommends.

-   Applications that tend to consume the entire available memory on a system
    are limited to consuming up to 80 percent of available RAM.

1.  If you are using Dynamic Memory on a Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server
    2012 R2 operating system, specify **Startup memory**, **Minimum memory**,
    and **Maximum memory** parameters in multiples of 128 megabytes (MB).
    Failure to do so can lead to hot-add failures, and you may not see any
    memory increase in a guest operating system.

2.  Certain distributions, including those using LIS 4.0 and 4.1, only provide
    Ballooning support and do not provide Hot-Add support. In such a scenario,
    the dynamic memory feature can be used by setting the Startup memory
    parameter to a value which is equal to the Maximum memory parameter. This
    results in all the requisite memory being Hot-Added to the virtual machine
    at boot time and then later depending upon the memory requirements of the
    host, Hyper-V can freely allocate or deallocate memory from the guest using
    Ballooning. Please configure **Startup Memory** and **Minimum Memory** at or
    above the recommended value for the distribution.

3.  To enable key/value pair (KVP) infrastructure, install the hypervkvpd or
    hyperv-daemons rpm package from your RHEL ISO. Alternatively the package can
    be installed directly from RHEL repositories.

4.  The key/value pair (KVP) infrastructure might not function correctly without
    a Linux software update. Contact your distribution vendor to obtain the
    software update in case you see problems with this feature.

5.  On Windows Server 2012 R2 Generation 2 virtual machines have secure boot
    enabled by default and some Linux virtual machines will not boot unless the
    secure boot option is disabled. You can disable secure boot in the
    **Firmware** section of the settings for the virtual machine in **Hyper-V
    Manager** or you can disable it using Powershell:

-   Set-VMFirmware -VMName "VMname" -EnableSecureBoot Off

    The Linux Integration Services download can be applied to existing
    Generation 2 VMs but does not impart Generation 2 capability.

1.  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 the filesystem
    freeze functionality is not available, so Live Virtual Machine Backup is
    also not available.
