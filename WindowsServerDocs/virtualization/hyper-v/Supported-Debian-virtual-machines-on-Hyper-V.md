# Supported Debian virtual machines on Hyper-V

>Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Azure Stack HCI, version 20H2; Windows Server 2019, Hyper-V Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Hyper-V Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Hyper-V Server 2012 R2, Windows 10, Windows 8.1

The following feature distribution map indicates the features that are present in each version. The known issues and workarounds for each distribution are listed after the table.

## Table legend

* **Built in** - LIS are included as part of this Linux distribution. The Microsoft-provided LIS download package doesn't work for this distribution so do not install it. The kernel module version numbers for the built in LIS (as shown by **lsmod**, for example) are different from the version number on the Microsoft-provided LIS download package. A mismatch does not indicate that the built in LIS is out of date.

* &#10004; - Feature available

* (*blank*) - Feature not available

## Notes

1. Creating file systems on VHDs larger than 2TB is not supported.

2. Starting with Debian 8.3 the manually-installed Debian package "hyperv-daemons" contains the key-value pair, fcopy, and VSS daemons. On Debian 7.x and 8.0-8.2 the hyperv-daemons package must come from [Debian backports](https://wiki.debian.org/Backports).

3. On Windows Server 2012 R2 Generation 2 virtual machines have secure boot enabled by default and some Linux virtual machines will not boot unless the secure boot option is disabled. You can disable secure boot in the **Firmware** section of the settings for the virtual machine in **Hyper-V Manager** or you can disable it using Powershell:

   ```Powershell
   Set-VMFirmware -VMName "VMname" -EnableSecureBoot Off
   ```
4. The latest upstream kernel capabilities are only available by using the kernels available in the [Debian Backports repository](https://wiki.debian.org/Backports).

5. While Debian 7.x is out of support and uses an older kernel, the kernel included in Debian backports for Debian 7.x has improved Hyper-V capabilities.
