# Supported Windows guest operating systems for Hyper-V on Windows, Windows Server, and Azure Local

Hyper-V supports several versions of Windows Server, Windows, and Linux distributions to run in virtual machines, as guest operating systems. This article covers supported Windows Server and Windows guest operating systems. For Linux and FreeBSD distributions, see [Supported Linux and FreeBSD virtual machines for Hyper-V on Windows](Supported-Linux-and-FreeBSD-virtual-machines-for-Hyper-V-on-Windows.md).

Some operating systems have the integration services built-in. Others require that you install or upgrade integration services as a separate step after you set up the operating system in the virtual machine. For more information, see the following sections and [Integration Services](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/integration-services).

Guest operating systems configurable components are confined based on the hosting operating system. To learn more about the maximum configurable components in Hyper-V, see [Plan for Hyper-V scalability in Windows Server](plan/plan-hyper-v-scalability-in-windows-server.md).

## Supported Windows Server guest operating systems

Following are the versions of Windows Server that are supported as guest operating systems for Hyper-V on Windows Server.

## How Microsoft provides support for guest operating systems

Microsoft provides support for guest operating systems in the following manner:

- Issues found in Microsoft operating systems and in integration services are supported by Microsoft support.

- For issues found in other operating systems that have been certified by the operating system vendor to run on Hyper-V, support is provided by the vendor.

- For issues found in other operating systems, Microsoft submits the issue to the multi-vendor support community, [TSANet](https://www.tsanet.org/).

In order to be supported, all operating systems (guest and host) must be up-to-date. Check Windows Update for critical updates.
