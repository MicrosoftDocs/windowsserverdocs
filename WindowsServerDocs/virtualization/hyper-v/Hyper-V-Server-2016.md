# Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2016

Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2016 is a stand\-alone product that contains only the Windows hypervisor, a Windows Server driver model, and virtualization components. It provides a simple and reliable virtualization solution to help you improve your server utilization and reduce costs.

The Windows hypervisor technology in Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2016 is the same as what's in the Hyper\-V role on Windows Server 2016. So, much of the content available for the Hyper\-V role on Windows Server 2016 also applies to Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2016.

|![Get started symbol](media/All_Symbols_GetStarted.png)|**Get started with Hyper-V Server**<p>[Download and install Microsoft Hyper\-V Server 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-hyper-v-server-2016). This installs the Windows hypervisor, a Windows Server driver model, and virtualization components. It's similar to running the Server Core installation option of Windows Server 2016 and the Hyper\-V role.|
|![Manage symbol](media/All_Symbols_Administrator.png)|**Configure and manage Hyper-V Server**<p>Hyper\-V Server doesn't have a graphical user interface \(GUI\). You can use the following tools to configure and manage Hyper\-V Server.<p>-   [Configure a Server Core installation of Windows Server 2016 with Sconfig.cmd](../../get-started/sconfig-on-ws2016.md) to update domain or workgroup settings, change Windows Update settings, enable remote management, and more.<br />-   Use an ordinary [command prompt](../../administration/windows-commands/windows-commands.md) for commands not available in Sconfig.<br />-   Use [Hyper\-V Manager](./manage/remotely-manage-hyper-v-hosts.md) or [Virtual Machine Manager](/system-center/vmm) to remotely manage  Hyper\-V Server. To use Hyper\-V Manager, [install the Hyper\-V role on Windows 10](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v) or [Windows Server 2016](get-started/install-the-hyper-v-role-on-windows-server.md).<br />-   See [Install Server Core](../../get-started/getting-started-with-server-core.md) for additional management options for basic server functions that aren't specific to Hyper\-V. Most of the management methods documented there also work with Hyper\-V Server.<p>**Configure and manage Hyper\-V virtual machines**<p>-   [Create a virtual switch for Hyper-V virtual machines](get-started/create-a-virtual-switch-for-hyper-v-virtual-machines.md)<br />-   [Create a virtual machine in Hyper-V](get-started/create-a-virtual-machine-in-hyper-v.md)<br />-   [Choose between standard or production checkpoints](manage/choose-between-standard-or-production-checkpoints-in-hyper-v.md)<br />-   [Enable or disable checkpoints](manage/enable-or-disable-checkpoints-in-hyper-v.md)<br />-   [Manage Windows virtual machines with PowerShell Direct](manage/manage-windows-virtual-machines-with-powershell-direct.md) <p>**Deploy**<p>-   [Set up hosts for live migration without Failover Clustering](deploy/set-up-hosts-for-live-migration-without-failover-clustering.md)<br />- [Upgrade Windows Server cluster nodes](../../failover-clustering/cluster-operating-system-rolling-upgrade.md)<br />- [Upgrade virtual machine version](deploy/upgrade-virtual-machine-version-in-hyper-v-on-windows-or-windows-server.md)<br />|
