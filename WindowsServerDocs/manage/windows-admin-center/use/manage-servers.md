# Manage servers in Windows Admin Center

> [!Tip]
> New to Windows Admin Center?
> [Download or learn more about Windows Admin Center](../overview.md).

You can add individual servers running Windows Server to Windows Admin Center so that you can manage them by using a comprehensive set of tools.

## Procedure for adding a server to Windows Admin Center

1. Under **All connections**, select **+ Add**.
2. For the **Servers** resource type, select **Add**.
3. Enter the name of the server. If you're prompted, enter the credentials to use.
4. Select **Add** to finish.

The server is added to your list of connections on the **All connections** page. Select it to connect to the server.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also add [failover clusters](manage-failover-clusters.md) or [hyper-converged clusters](manage-hyper-converged.md) as a separate connection in Windows Admin Center.
