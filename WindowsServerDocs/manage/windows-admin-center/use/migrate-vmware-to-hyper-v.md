You can use Windows Admin Center to migrate VMware virtual machines from vCenter to Hyper-V with the **VM Conversion extension**. This lightweight tool enables online replication with minimal downtime for both Windows and Linux virtual machines. The conversion tool is easy and fast to set up, at no cost to customers.

In this article, you learn how to install and configure the extension, follow the synchronization and migration workflow, and find answers to common questions.

## Feature overview

The **VM Conversion extension** provides the following key features:

- **Bulk migration**: Supports a batch of 10 virtual machines migration at-a-time. This enables admins to group virtual machines based on:

  - **Application dependency** – virtual machines that are part of the same application stack or service.
  - **Cluster dependency** – virtual machines that need to be distributed on nodes within same cluster.
  - **Business boundaries** – virtual machines servicing different business within a company. For example, test machines and preproduction machines.
  - **Rack dependency** – virtual machines running on hosts on a rack.

- **Cluster-aware migration**: Supports migration virtual machines from eSXI hosts to Windows Server Failover clusters.

- **Static IP configurations**: Persists the static IP configurations of virtual machines from source to destination Hyper-V hosts. This reduces post-migration tasks and enables seamless network continuity.

- **Secure Boot and UEFI template configuration**: Provides enhanced security and compliance.
  - Integrated osType across the migration flow for accurate secure boot and UEFI setup.
  - Secure boot settings are dynamically configured based on OS, either Windows or Linux.
  - Added error handling for unsupported OS types.

- **Localization support**: Improves user experience using this tool in different languages.

- **Multiple vCenter connections**: Users can add multiple vCenter endpoints in order to switch between vCenters.

- **Multi-disk support**: Ensures all attached virtual disks are migrated and synchronized for virtual machines running complex workloads.​

- **Prechecks**: Catches failures early in replication, and migration phases.

- **Cleanup**: Removes VMware Tools from Windows VMs post-migration.

## Frequently asked questions

- Does the tool support both Static and DHCP IP addresses?

    Yes, both DHCP and Static IP addresses are supported.

    Static IP is supported using scripts. When a static IP is detected, the VM credentials are collected to run the script and capture the IP address details. It's persisted on the target Hyper-V host post cutover phase.

- How does the tool handle VM boot types?

    The tool automatically detects the source VM’s boot type. **BIOS boot** creates a Generation 1 VM on Hyper-V. **UEFI boot** creates a Generation 2 VM on Hyper-V.

- Why are migrated VM disks showing as Dynamic instead of Static (Fixed)?

    The VM Conversion tool currently migrates disks as **dynamically expanding (thin provisioned)** VHDX files, which means only the used portion of the disk is copied—not the full allocated size.

    During migration, a VM with a **provisioned size of 500 GB** but **actual usage of 250 GB** results in a 250 GB dynamic VHDX on the destination. While this is space-efficient, it might cause storage management issues later.

    After migration, customers should convert the VHDX to a fixed size to reflect the full provisioned storage using the PowerShell command:

    ```powershell
    Convert-VHD -Path "C:\VMs\MyDisk.vhdx" -DestinationPath "C:\VMs\MyDisk_Fixed.vhdx" -VHDType Fixed
    ```
- Is VMware to Azure Local migration supported?

    No, the tool doesn't support migration to Azure Local. Use [Azure Migrate to migrate virtual machines to Azure Local](/azure/azure-local/migrate/migration-azure-migrate-vmware-overview).

- Does the tool support virtual machines running on a virtual storage area network (vSAN)?

    No, the tool doesn't support virtual machines running on vSAN?

- Is this tool available in Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal?

    No, the conversion tool is only available in Windows Admin Center on-premises.
  
- How is memory configured during virtual machine migration?

    During migration, memory is configured as static, even if the source virtual machine is set to use dynamic memory. This is a design choice to ensure migration stability and compatibility between VMware and Hyper-V memory management.

    To re-enable dynamic memory of change RAM parameters after migration:

    1. Open **Windows Admin Center**.
    1. Navigate to the **Virtual machines** extension.
    1. Power off the migrated virtual machine.
    1. Select **Settings**.
    1. Update the required memory parameters: Startup memory, Enable dynamic memory, Minimum memory, Maximum memory, and Memory buffer.
    1. Save changes and **power on** the virtual machine.

- What are the current limitations of this migration tool?

  - The Resync option provides the capability to do data synchronization between initial replication and delta replication. The Resync option isn't supported.

  - VMware Tools aren't automatically uninstalled post-migration—remove them manually if needed.

  - Hyper-V drivers must be installed on Linux machines before starting migration. Download and install [Linux Integration Services v4.3](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=55106) for Hyper-V and Azure.​

  - During virtual machine conversion, the BIOS GUID on the destination virtual machine won't match the source virtual machine unless it's manually updated. This might affect virtual machine identity synchronization, or licensing checks that rely on consistent BIOS-level identifiers. BIOS-level identifiers must be updated in virtual machine identity synchronization, and migration.

    <details>
    <summary>Expand this section and use the script provided to update the BIOS GUID on the migrated Hyper-V virtual machine.</summary>

    To update the BIOS GUID for a Hyper-V virtual machine:

    1. Extract the following script into a file named `Update-VMBiosInfo.ps1`.
    1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
    1. Run the script with the required parameters: `.\Update-VMBiosInfo.ps1 -VMName "VM Name" -BiosGuid "New BIOS GUID"`

    ```powershell
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Updates the BIOS GUID of a specified Hyper-V virtual machine.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    This script stops a specified Hyper-V virtual machine, updates its BIOS GUID using CIM (Common Information Model), and WMIv2 (root\virtualization\v2), and then restarts the VM. It handles both synchronous and asynchronous operations triggered by the Hyper-V Management Service.
    
    It's particularly useful in scenarios such as VM identity synchronization, VM migration, or reconfiguration where BIOS-level identifiers are required to be updated.
    
    .PARAMETER VMName
    The name of the Hyper-V virtual machine whose BIOS GUID is to be updated.
    
    .PARAMETER BiosGuid
    The new BIOS GUID to assign to the virtual machine. The script automatically formats the GUID with braces if not provided.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    .\Update-VMBiosInfo.ps1 -VMName "Contoso" -BiosGuid "{423A2700-F96D-561B-B421-C3088111A97B}"
    
    This command updates the BIOS GUID of the virtual machine named "Contoso" to the specified GUID.

## Troubleshooting guide
>[!NOTE]
>For issues or questions not covered in this documentation, you can submit feedback [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Windows-Admin-Center-Ideas-and-Feedback). 

### Issue 1: VM resync/remigrate required, or migration stuck at a certain percentage (session timeout)

**Symptom:**

- User wants to resync or remigrate a VM.
- Migration is stuck at a certain percentage due to a session timeout.

**Resolution:**

1. Delete the relevant entries from the following files on the Windows Admin Center gateway machine:

   ```
   C:\Program Files\Windows Admin Center\Service\migrationStatus.json
   C:\Program Files\Windows Admin Center\Service\syncStatus.json
   ```
1. If the VM already exists in **Hyper-V Manager**, delete it before reinitiating the migration.

---

### Issue 2: Cancel VM synchronization or migration in progress

**Symptom:**

- User wants to cancel a synchronization or migration while it is in progress.

**Resolution:**
Cancellation isn't supported directly in the extension. As a workaround:

1. Stop the **Windows Admin Center service**.
2. Restart the service. This will release all running threads.
3. Delete the relevant entries from the following files to ensure status does not continue to show as "In Progress":

   ```
   C:\Program Files\Windows Admin Center\Service\migrationStatus.json
   C:\Program Files\Windows Admin Center\Service\syncStatus.json
   ```

---

### Issue 3: Migration precheck fails with error

**Error message:**

> *"Failed to retrieve the list of VMs from the destination server. Please ensure the destination server is reachable and retry the operation."*

**Resolution:**

- Ensure there are no **failed virtual machines** present on the same destination server.

---

### Issue 4: Static IP migration failure for Windows VMs

**Symptom:**

* Static IP configuration does not migrate successfully for a Windows VM.

**Resolution:**

1. Download the [**static IP migration package (.zip)**](https://aka.ms/hci-migrate-static-ip-download), which contains scripts for both Windows and Linux VMs.
2. Extract the package to a specified path inside the guest VM **after synchronization and before migration**.
3. Open a PowerShell window as Administrator.
4. Navigate to the extracted path.
5. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   .\Prepare-MigratedVM.ps1 -StaticIPMigration -Verbose
   ```
