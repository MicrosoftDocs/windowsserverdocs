Windows Admin Center (non-preview) releases are supported continuously, based on Microsoft's [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy). This means that only the latest version of Windows Admin Center is serviced and supported, and users must stay current by upgrading to the latest Windows Admin Center release within 30 days of availability to remain supported. This policy applies to both the Windows Admin Center platform itself, as well as any released (non-preview) Microsoft extensions published in the Windows Admin Center extension feed. Note that some extensions may be updated more frequently than others, between Windows Admin Center releases.
