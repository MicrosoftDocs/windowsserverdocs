# What type of installation is right for you?

>Applies To: Windows Admin Center, Windows Admin Center Preview

## Supported operating systems: Installation

You can install Windows Admin Center on the following Windows operating systems:

| **Version** | **Installation Type** |
|-------------|-----------------------|
|Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) or newer | Desktop mode |
|Windows Server, version 1709 | Gateway mode |
|Windows Server 2016 | Gateway mode |
|Windows Server 2019 (insider builds) | Gateway mode |

**Desktop installation:** Connect to the Windows Admin Center gateway from the same computer on which it's installed (i.e. `https://localhost:[port]`)

**Gateway service:** Connect to the Windows Admin Center gateway from a client browser on a different machine (i.e. `https://servername`) 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't use Internet Explorer to manage Windows Admin Center - instead you need to use a [supported browser](../understand/faq.md#which-web-browsers-are-supported-by-windows-admin-center
).  If you are installing Windows Admin Center on Windows Server, we recommend managing by connecting remotely with Windows 10 and Edge.  Alternatively, you can manage locally on Windows Server if you have installed a supported browser.

## Supported operating systems: Management

You can use Windows Admin Center to manage the following Windows operating systems:

| **Version** | **Managed node** via Server Manager | **Managed cluster** via Failover Cluster Mgr | **Managed HCI cluster** via HCI Cluster Mgr (preview)|
|-------------------------|---------------|-----|------------------------|
| Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) or newer | Yes (via Computer Management) | N/A | N/A |
| Windows Server 2019 (insider builds) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Windows Server, version 1709 | Yes | Yes | No |
| Windows Server 2016 | Yes | Yes | Yes, with [latest cumulative update](../use/manage-hyper-converged.md#prepare-your-windows-server-2016-cluster-for-windows-admin-center) |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | Yes | Yes | N/A |
| Windows Server 2012 | Yes | Yes | N/A |
| Windows Server 2008 R2* | Yes, limited functionality | N/A | N/A |

*Windows Server 2008 R2 management is only supported in Windows Admin Center Preview

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Admin Center requires PowerShell features that are not included in Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012, and 2012 R2. If you will manage Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012, or 2012 R2 with Windows Admin Center, you will need to install Windows Management Framework (WMF) version 5.1 or higher on those servers.

>Type `$PSVersiontable` in PowerShell to verify that WMF is installed,
and that the version is 5.1 or higher. 

>If WMF is not installed, you can [download WMF 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616).

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Admin Center does not function propertly using the default browser Internet Explorer. If you open the Admin Center using IE, you see just a blank screen. You need to use either Microsoft Edge or Google's Chrome to use the Admin Center at present.

        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
Install on a local Windows 10 client that has connectivity to the managed servers.  Great for quick start, testing, ad-hoc or small scale scenarios.
        </td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
Install directly on a managed server for the purpose of managing itself or a cluster in which it's a member node.
        </td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
Install on a designated gateway server and access from any client browser with connectivity to the gateway server.
        </td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
Deploy in a failover cluster to enable high availability of the gateway service. Great for production environments to ensure resiliency of your management service.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## High availability
You can enable high availability of the gateway service by deploying Windows Admin Center in a active-passive model on a failover cluster. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, Windows Admin Center gracefully fails over to another node, letting you continue managing the servers in your environment seamlessly.
