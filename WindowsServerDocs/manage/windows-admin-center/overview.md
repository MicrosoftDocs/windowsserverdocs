# Windows Admin Center overview

Windows Admin Center is a remote management tool for Windows Server running anywhere&mdash;physical, virtual, on-premises, in Azure, or in a hosted environment&mdash;at no extra cost.

To find out what's new, see [Release history](support/release-history.md).

## Download now

**Download [Windows Admin Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/download-windows-admin-center)** from the Microsoft Evaluation Center.

For installation help, see [Install](deploy/install.md). For tips on getting started with Windows Admin Center, see [Get started](use/get-started.md).

You can update non-preview versions of Windows Admin Center by using Microsoft Update or by manually downloading and installing Windows Admin Center. Each non-preview version of Windows Admin Center is supported until 30 days after the next non-preview version is released. See our [support policy](support/index.md) for more info.

## Windows Admin Center scenarios

Here are a few things you can use Windows Admin Center for:

- **Simplify server management**: Manage your servers and clusters with modernized versions of familiar tools such as Server Manager. Install in under five minutes and manage servers in your environment immediately, no extra configuration required. For details, see [What is Windows Admin Center?](understand/what-is.md)

- **Work with hybrid solutions**: Integration with Azure helps you optionally connect your on-premises servers with relevant cloud services. For details, see [Azure hybrid services](azure/index.md).

- **Streamline hyperconverged management**: Streamline management of Azure Local or Windows Server hyperconverged clusters. Use simplified workloads to create and manage VMs, Storage Spaces Direct volumes, Software-Defined Networking and more. For details, see [Manage HCI](use/manage-hyper-converged.md).
