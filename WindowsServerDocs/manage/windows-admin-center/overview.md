# Windows Admin Center

> Applies to: Windows Admin Center, Windows Admin Center Preview

Windows Admin Center is a locally deployed, browser-based app for managing Windows servers, clusters, hyper-converged infrastructure, as well as Windows 10 PCs. It is a free product and is ready to use in production.

To find out what's new, see [Release history](support/release-history.md).

## Download now

**Download [Windows Admin Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-admin-center)** from the Microsoft Evaluation Center. Even though it says “Start your evaluation”, this is the generally available version for production use.

For help installing, see [Install](deploy/install.md). For tips on getting started with Windows Admin Center, see [Get started](use/get-started.md).

You can update non-preview versions of Windows Admin Center by using Microsoft Update or by manually downloading and installing Windows Admin Center. Each non-preview version of Windows Admin Center is supported until 30 days after the next non-preview version is released. See our [support policy](support/index.md) for more info.

## Windows Admin Center scenarios

Here are a few things you can use Windows Admin Center for:

- **Simplify server management** Manage your servers and clusters with modernized versions of familiar tools such as Server Manager. Install in under five minutes and manage servers in your environment immediately, no additional configuration required. For details, see [What is Windows Admin Center?](understand/what-is.md).

- **Work with hybrid solutions** Integration with Azure helps you optionally connect your on-premises servers with relevant cloud services. For details, see [Azure hybrid services](azure/index.md)

- **Streamline hyperconverged management** Streamline management of Azure Stack HCI or Windows Server hyperconverged clusters. Use simplified workloads to create and manage VMs, Storage Spaces Direct volumes, Software-Defined Networking and more. For details, see [Manage Hyper-Converged Infrastructure with Windows Admin Center](use/manage-hyper-converged.md)
