> [Learn more about Windows Admin Center](../overview.md) or [Download now](../overview.md).

## Determine your installation type

Review the [installation options](../plan/installation-options.md) which includes the [supported operating systems](../plan/installation-options.md#installation-supported-operating-systems). To install Windows Admin Center on a virtual machine in Azure, see [Deploy Windows Admin Center in Azure](../azure/deploy-wac-in-azure.md).

## Prerequisites

To install Windows Admin Center, you need the following prerequisites:

- A Windows PC or server to install Windows Admin Center on.

- Administrative privileges or equivalent permissions on the machine you're installing Windows Admin Center on.

- Optional: An SSL certificate used for _Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)_. You can use a self-signed certificate for testing, but you should always use a certificate from a trusted certificate authority for production environments. If you don't have a certificate, you can use the Windows Admin Center installer to generate a self-signed certificate. The certificate is valid for 60 days.

## Upgrade to a new version

You can update non-preview versions of Windows Admin Center by using Microsoft Update or a manual installation.

Windows Admin Center preserves your settings when you upgrade to the latest version. Upgrading Insider Preview versions of Windows Admin Center isn't supported, we recommend you do a new installation by installing the latest version of Preview and starting over.

## Update the certificate used by Windows Admin Center

When you have Windows Admin Center deployed as a service, you must provide a certificate for HTTPS. To update this certificate, use the following these steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When changing your certificate, you need to restart the Windows Admin Center service for the changes to take effect.

1. Sign-in to your machine. If you're on Server core, from the SConfig menu, enter option **15**, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   to open a PowerShell session. If you're on the desktop experience, remote desktop into your VM and launch PowerShell.

1. Import the Windows Admin Center configuration PowerShell module using the following command:

   ```powershell
   Import-Module "$env:ProgramFiles\WindowsAdminCenter\PowerShellModules\Microsoft.WindowsAdminCenter.Configuration"
   ```

1. Apply the new certificate using the following command, making sure to replace `<subject name>` with the subject name of the certificate:

   ```powershell
   Set-WACCertificateSubjectName -SubjectName "<subject name>"
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > Make sure the certificate uses a unique subject name. Alternatively, you can use the SHA1 thumbprint of the certificate using the **Thumbprint** parameter.

1. Updated the certificate access control list to grant permissions for the _Network Service_ account to access the certificate. Use the following command, replacing `<subject name>` with the subject name of the certificate:

   ```powershell
   Set-WACCertificateAcl -SubjectName "<subject name>"
   ```

1. Restart the Windows Admin Center service using the following command:

   ```powershell
   Restart-Service -Name WindowsAdminCenter
   ```

You've now updated the certificate used by Windows Admin Center.
