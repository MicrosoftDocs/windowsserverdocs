## Determine your installation type

Review the [installation options](../plan/installation-options.md) which includes the [supported operating systems](../plan/installation-options.md#installation-supported-operating-systems). To install Windows Admin Center on a virtual machine in Azure, see [Deploy Windows Admin Center in Azure](../azure/deploy-wac-in-azure.md).

## Prerequisites

To install Windows Admin Center, you need the following prerequisites:

- A Windows PC or server to install Windows Admin Center on.

- Administrative privileges or equivalent permissions on the machine you're installing Windows Admin Center on.

- Optional: An SSL certificate used for _Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)_. You can use a self-signed certificate for testing, but you should always use a certificate from a trusted certificate authority for production environments. If you don't have a certificate, you can use the Windows Admin Center installer to generate a self-signed certificate. The certificate is valid for 60 days.
