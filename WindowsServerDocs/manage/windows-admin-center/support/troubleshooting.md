# Troubleshooting Windows Admin Center

> Applies to: Windows Admin Center, Windows Admin Center Preview, Azure Stack HCI, version v20H2

> [!Important]
> This guide will help you diagnose and resolve issues that are preventing you from using Windows Admin Center. If you are having an issue with a specific tool, please check to see if you are experiencing a [known issue.](./known-issues.md)

## Installer fails with message: **_The Module 'Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts' could not be loaded._**

This can happen if your default PowerShell module path has been modified or removed. To resolve the issue, make sure that ```%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules``` is the **first** item in your PSModulePath environment variable. You can achieve this with the following line of PowerShell:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PSModulePath","%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules;" + ([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PSModulePath","User")),"User")
```

## I get a **This site/page can't be reached** error in my web browser

### If you've installed Windows Admin Center as an **App on Windows 10**

* Check to make sure Windows Admin Center is running. Look for the Windows Admin Center icon ![Windows Admin Center icon](../media/trayIcon.PNG) in the System tray or **Windows Admin Center Desktop / SmeDesktop.exe** in Task Manager. If not, launch **Windows Admin Center** from the Start Menu.

> [!NOTE]
> After rebooting, you must launch Windows Admin Center from the Start Menu.

* [Check the Windows version](#check-the-windows-version)

* Make sure you are using either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome as your web browser.

* Did you select the correct certificate on [first launch?](../use/get-started.md#selecting-a-client-certificate)

  * Try opening your browser in a private session - if that works, you'll need to clear your cache.

* Did you recently upgrade Windows 10 to a new build or version?

  * This may have cleared your trusted hosts settings. [Follow these instructions to update your trusted hosts settings.](#configure-trustedhosts)

### If you've installed Windows Admin Center as a **Gateway on Windows Server**

* [Check the Windows version](#check-the-windows-version) of the client and server.

* Make sure you are using either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome as your web browser.

* On the server, open Task Manager > Services and make sure **ServerManagementGateway / Windows Admin Center** is running.

    ![Task Manager - Services tab](../media/Service-TaskMan.PNG)

* Test the network connection to the Gateway (replace \<values> with the information from your deployment)

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -Port <port> -ComputerName <gateway> -InformationLevel Detailed
    ```

### If you have installed Windows Admin Center in an Azure Windows Server VM

* [Check the Windows version](#check-the-windows-version)
* Did you add an inbound port rule for HTTPS?
* [Learn more about installing Windows Admin Center in an Azure VM](../azure/azure-integration.md)

### Check the Windows version

* Open the run dialog (Windows Key + R) and launch ```winver```.

* If you are using Windows 10 version 1703 or below, Windows Admin Center is not supported on your version of Microsoft Edge. Either upgrade to a recent version of Windows 10 or use Chrome.

* If you are using an insider preview version of Windows 10 or Server with a build version between 17134 and 17637, Windows had a bug which caused Windows Admin Center to fail. Please use a current supported version of Windows.

### Make sure the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service is running on both the gateway machine and managed node

* Open the run dialog with WindowsKey + R
* Type ```services.msc``` and press enter
* In the window that opens, look for Windows Remote Management (WinRM), make sure it is running and set to automatically start

### If you're getting WinRM error messages while managing servers in Windows Admin Center

WinRM doesn't allow credential delegation by default. To allow delegation, the computer needs to have Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) enabled temporarily.

If you're receiving WinRM error messages, try using the verification steps in the [Manual troubleshooting](/azure-stack/hci/manage/troubleshoot-credssp#manual-troubleshooting) section of [Troubleshoot CredSSP](/azure-stack/hci/manage/troubleshoot-credssp) to resolve them.

### Did you upgrade your server from 2016 to 2019?

* This may have cleared your trusted hosts settings. [Follow these instructions to update your trusted hosts settings.](#configure-trustedhosts)

## I get the message: "Cant connect securely to this page. This might be because the site uses outdated or unsafe TLS security settings.

Your machine is restricted to HTTP/2 connections. Windows Admin Center uses integrated Windows authentication, which is not supported in HTTP/2. Add the following two registry values under the ```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Http\Parameters``` key on **the machine running the browser** to remove the HTTP/2 restriction:

```
EnableHttp2Cleartext=dword:00000000
EnableHttp2Tls=dword:00000000
```

## I'm having trouble with the Remote Desktop, Events, and PowerShell tools.

These three tools require the websocket protocol, which is commonly blocked by proxy servers and firewalls. If you are using Google Chrome, there is a [known issue](known-issues.md#google-chrome) with websockets and NTLM authentication.

## I can connect to some servers, but not others

* Log on to the gateway machine locally and try to ```Enter-PSSession <machine name>``` in PowerShell, replacing \<machine name> with the name of the Machine you are trying to manage in Windows Admin Center.

* If your environment uses a workgroup instead of a domain, see [using Windows Admin Center in a workgroup](#using-windows-admin-center-in-a-workgroup).

* **Using local administrator accounts:** If you are using a local user account that is not the built-in administrator account, you will need to enable the policy on the target machine by running the following command in PowerShell or at a Command Prompt as Administrator on the target machine:

    ```
    REG ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1
    ```

## Using Windows Admin Center in a workgroup

### What account are you using?
Make sure the credentials you are using are a member of the target server's local administrators group. In some cases, WinRM also requires membership in the Remote Management Users group. If you are using a local user account that is **not the built-in administrator account**, you will need to enable the policy on the target machine by running the following command in PowerShell or at a Command Prompt as Administrator on the target machine:

```cmd
REG ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1
```
### Are you connecting to a workgroup machine on a different subnet?

To connect to a workgroup machine that is not on the same subnet as the gateway, make sure the firewall port for WinRM (TCP 5985) allows inbound traffic on the target machine. You can run the following command in PowerShell or at a Command Prompt as Administrator on the target machine to create this firewall rule:

- **Windows Server**

    ```powershell
    Set-NetFirewallRule -Name WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP-PUBLIC -RemoteAddress Any
    ```

- **Windows 10**

    ```powershell
    Set-NetFirewallRule -Name WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP -RemoteAddress Any
    ```

### Configure TrustedHosts

When installing Windows Admin Center, you are given the option to let Windows Admin Center manage the gateway's TrustedHosts setting. This is required in a workgroup environment, or when using local administrator credentials in a domain. If you choose to forego this setting, you must configure TrustedHosts manually.

**To modify TrustedHosts using PowerShell commands:**

1. Open an Administrator PowerShell session.
2. View your current TrustedHosts setting:

    ```powershell
    Get-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts
    ```

   > [!WARNING]
   > If the current setting of your TrustedHosts is not empty, the commands below will overwrite your setting. We recommend that you save the current setting to a text file with the following command so you can restore it if needed:
   >
   > `Get-Item WSMan:localhost\Client\TrustedHosts | Out-File C:\OldTrustedHosts.txt`

3. Set TrustedHosts to the NetBIOS, IP, or FQDN of the machines you
   intend to manage:

    ```powershell
    Set-Item WSMan:localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value '192.168.1.1,server01.contoso.com,server02'
    ```

   > [!TIP]
   > For an easy way to set all TrustedHosts at once, you can use a wildcard.
   >
   > ```powershell
   > Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value '*'
   > ```

4. When you are done testing, you can issue the following command from an elevated PowerShell session to clear your TrustedHosts setting:

    ```powershell
    Clear-Item WSMan:localhost\Client\TrustedHosts
    ```

5. If you had previously exported your settings, open the file, copy the values, and use this command:

    ```powershell
    Set-Item WSMan:localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value '<paste values from text file>'
    ```

## I previously had Windows Admin Center installed, and now nothing else can use the same TCP/IP port

Manually run these two commands in an elevated command prompt:

```cmd
netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:443
netsh http delete urlacl url=https://+:443/
```

## Azure features don't work properly in Edge

Edge has [known issues](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js/wiki/Known-issues-on-Edge) related to security zones that affect Azure login in Windows Admin Center. If you are having trouble using Azure features when using Edge, try adding https://login.microsoftonline.com, https://login.live.com and the URL of your gateway as trusted sites and to allowed sites for Edge pop-up blocker settings on your client side browser.

To do this:
1. Search for **Internet Options** in the Windows Start Menu
2. Go to the **Security** tab
3. Under the **Trusted Sites** option, click on the **sites** button and add the URLs in the dialog box that opens. You'll need to add your gateway URL as well as https://login.microsoftonline.com and https://login.live.com.
4. Go to the **Privacy** tab
5. Under the **Pop-up Blocker** section, click on the **Settings** button and add the URLs in the dialog box that opens. You'll need to add your gateway URL as well as https://login.microsoftonline.com and https://login.live.com.
