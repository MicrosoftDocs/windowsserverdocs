# BiitOps Changes Extension

BiitOps Changes for Windows Admin Center gives you insight into changes to hardware, software and configuration settings on your Windows Server physical/virtual machines. The BiitOps Changes extension enables you to quickly and cost-effectively determine changes which cause issues related to compliance, reliability or security. It will show precisely what is new, what has changed and what has been deleted in a single-pane-of-glass. It works on both servers and selected services on Microsoft Windows Server.
