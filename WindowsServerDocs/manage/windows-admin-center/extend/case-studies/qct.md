## A simple path to server infrastructure management

The QCT Management Suite extension for Windows Admin Center provides a single pane of glass dashboard for monitoring system configurations and managing server health of [QCT Azure Stack HCI certified systems](https://go.qct.io/solutions/enterprise-private-cloud/qxstack-windows-server-cloud-ready-appliances/windows-server-software-defined-solution-wssd/) : [QuantaGrid D52BQ-2U](https://www.qct.io/product/index/Server/rackmount-server/2U-Rackmount-Server/QuantaGrid-D52BQ-2U), [QuantaGrid D52T-1ULH](https://www.qct.io/product/index/Storage/Storage-Server/1U-Storage-Server/QuantaGrid-D52T-1ULH) and [QuantaPlex T21P-4U](https://www.qct.io/product/index/Storage/Storage-Server/4U-Storage-Server/QuantaPlex-T21P-4U).
