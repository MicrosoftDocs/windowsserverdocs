# Extensions for Windows Admin Center

>Applies To: Windows Admin Center, Windows Admin Center Preview

Windows Admin Center is built as an extensible platform to enable partners and developers to leverage existing capabilities within Windows Admin Center, seamlessly integrate with other IT administration products and solutions, and provide additional value to customers. Each solution and tool in Windows Admin Center is built as an extension using the same extensibility features available to partners and developers, so you can build powerful tools just like the ones available in Windows Admin Center today.

Windows Admin Center extensions are built using modern web technologies including HTML5, CSS, Angular, TypeScript and jQuery, and can manage target servers via PowerShell or WMI. You can also manage target servers, services or devices over different protocols such as REST by building a Windows Admin Center gateway plugin.

## Why you should consider developing an extension for Windows Admin Center

Here's the value you can bring to your product and customers by developing extensions for Windows Admin Center:

- **Integrate with Windows Admin Center tools:** Integrate your products and services with server and cluster management tools in Windows Admin Center and deliver unified and seamless, end-to-end monitoring, management, troubleshooting experiences to your customers.
- **Leverage platform security, identity and management capabilities:** Enable Azure Active Directory (AAD) support, Multi-Factor Authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), logging, auditing for your product and services by leveraging Windows Admin Center platform capabilities to meet the complex requirements of today's IT organizations.
- **Develop using the latest web technologies:** Quickly build stunning user experiences using modern web technologies including HTML5, CSS, Angular, TypeScript and jQuery, and rich, powerful UI controls included in the Windows Admin Center SDK.
- **Extend product outreach:** Become a part of the Windows Admin Center ecosystem with outreach to our expanding customer base.

## Start developing with the Windows Admin Center SDK

Getting started with Windows Admin Center development is easy!  Sample code can be found for [tool](develop-tool.md), [solution](develop-solution.md), and [gateway plugin](develop-gateway-plugin.md) extension types in our SDK documentation. There you will leverage the Windows Admin Center CLI to build a new extension project, then follow the individual guides to customize your project to meet your needs.

We've made a Windows Admin Center [SDK design toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-admin-center-sdk/blob/master/WindowsAdminCenterDesignToolkit.zip) available to help you rapidly mock up extensions in PowerPoint using Windows Admin Center styles, controls, and page templates. See what your extension can look like in Windows Admin Center before you start coding!

We also have sample code hosted on GitHub: [Developer Tools](https://aka.ms/wacsdk) is a sample solution extension containing a rich collection of controls that you can browse and use in your own extension. Developer Tools is a fully functioning extension that can be side-loaded into Windows Admin Center in Developer Mode.

See the topics below to learn more about the SDK and get started:

- [Develop an extension](developing-extensions.md)
- [Guides](guides.md)
- [Publish your extension](publish-extensions.md)
