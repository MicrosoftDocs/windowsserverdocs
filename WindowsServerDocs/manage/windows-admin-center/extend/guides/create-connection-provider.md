# Create a connection provider for a solution extension

>Applies To: Windows Admin Center, Windows Admin Center Preview

Connection Providers play an important role in how Windows Admin Center defines and communicates with connectable objects, or targets. Primarily, a Connection Provider performs actions while a connection is being made, such as ensuring that the target is online and available, and also ensuring that the connecting user has permission to access the target.

By default, Windows Admin Center ships with the following Connection Providers:

* Server
* Windows Client
* Failover Cluster
* HCI Cluster

To create your own custom Connection Provider, follow these steps:

* Add Connection Provider details to ```manifest.json```
* Define Connection Status Provider
* Implement Connection Provider in application layer

## Add Connection Provider details to manifest.json

Now we'll walk through what you need to know to define a Connection Provider in your project's ```manifest.json``` file.

### Create entry in manifest.json

The ```manifest.json``` file is located in the \src folder and contains, among other things, definitions of entry points into your project. Types of entry points include Tools, Solutions, and Connection Providers. We'll be defining a Connection Provider.

A sample of a Connection Provider entry in manifest.json is below:

``` json
    {
      "entryPointType": "connectionProvider",
      "name": "addServer",
      "path": "/add",
      "displayName": "resources:strings:addServer_displayName",
      "icon": "sme-icon:icon-win-server",
      "description": "resources:strings:description",
      "connectionType": "msft.sme.connection-type.server",
      "connectionTypeName": "resources:strings:addServer_connectionTypeName",
      "connectionTypeUrlName": "server",
      "connectionTypeDefaultSolution": "msft.sme.server-manager!servers",
      "connectionTypeDefaultTool": "msft.sme.server-manager!overview",
      "connectionStatusProvider": {
        "powerShell": {
          "script": "## Get-My-Status ##\nfunction Get-Status()\n{\n# A function like this would be where logic would exist to identify if a node is connectable.\n$status = @{label = $null; type = 0; details = $null; }\n$caption = \"MyConstCaption\"\n$productType = \"MyProductType\"\n# A result object needs to conform to the following object structure to be interpreted properly by the Windows Admin Center shell.\n$result = @{ status = $status; caption = $caption; productType = $productType; version = $version }\n# DO FANCY LOGIC #\n# Once the logic is complete, the following fields need to be populated:\n$status.label = \"Display Thing\"\n$status.type = 0 # This value needs to conform to the LiveConnectionStatusType enum. >= 3 represents a failure.\n$status.details = \"success stuff\"\nreturn $result}\nGet-Status"
        },
        "displayValueMap": {
          "wmfMissing-label": "resources:strings:addServer_status_wmfMissing_label",
          "wmfMissing-details": "resources:strings:addServer_status_wmfMissing_details",
          "unsupported-label": "resources:strings:addServer_status_unsupported_label",
          "unsupported-details": "resources:strings:addServer_status_unsupported_details"
        }
      }
    },
```

An entry point of type "connnectionProvider" indicates to the Windows Admin Center shell that the item being configured is a provider that will be used by a Solution to validate a connection state. Connection Provider entry points contains a number of important properties, defined below:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| entryPointType | This is a required property. There are three valid values: "tool", "solution", and "connectionProvider". |
| name | Identifies the Connection Provider within the scope of a Solution. This value must be unique inside a full Windows Admin Center instance (not just a Solution). |
| path | Represents the URL path for the "Add Connection" UI, if it will be configured by the Solution. This value must map to a route that is configured in app-routing.module.ts file. When the Solution entry point is configured to use the connections rootNavigationBehavior, this route will load the module that is used by the Shell to display the Add Connection UI. More information available in the section on rootNavigationBehavior. |
| displayName | The value entered here is displayed on the right hand side of the shell, below the black Windows Admin Center bar when a user loads a Solution's connections page. |
| icon | Represents the icon used in the Solutions drop down menu to represent the Solution. |
| description | Enter a short description of the entry point. |
| connectionType | Represents the connection type that the provider will load. The value entered here will also be used in the Solution entry point to specify that the Solution can load those connections. The value entered here will also be used in Tool entry point(s) to indicate that the Tool is compatible with this type. This value entered here will also be used in the connection object that is submitted to the RPC call on the "Add window", in the application layer implementation step. |
| connectionTypeName | Used in the connections table to represent a connection that uses your Connection Provider. This is expected to be the plural name of the type. |
| connectionTypeUrlName | Used in creating the URL to represent the loaded Solution, after Windows Admin Center has connected to an instance. This entry is used after connections, and before the target. In this example, "connectionexample" is where this value appears in the URL: `http://localhost:6516/solutionexample/connections/connectionexample/con-fake1.corp.contoso.com` |
| connectionTypeDefaultSolution | Represents the default component that should be loaded by the Connection Provider. This value is a combination of: <br>[a] The name of the extension package defined at the top of the manifest; <br>[b] Exclamation point (!); <br>[c] The Solution entry point name.	<br>For a project with name "msft.sme.mySample-extension", and a Solution entry point with name "example", this value would be "msft.sme.solutionExample-extension!example". |
| connectionTypeDefaultTool | Represents the default Tool that should be loaded on a successful connection. This property value is made up of two parts, similar to the connectionTypeDefaultSolution. This value is a combination of: <br>[a] The name of the extension package defined at the top of the manifest; <br>[b] Exclamation point (!); <br>[c] The Tool entry point name for the Tool that should be loaded initially. <br>For a project with name "msft.sme.solutionExample-extension", and a Solution entry point with name "example", this value would be "msft.sme.solutionExample-extension!example". |

## Define Connection Status Provider

Connection Status Provider is the mechanism by which a target is validated to be online and available, also ensuring that the connecting user has permission to access the target. There are currently two types of Connection Status Providers:  PowerShell, and RelativeGatewayUrl.

*	<strong>PowerShell Connection Status Provider</strong> - Determines if a target is online and accessible with a PowerShell script. The result must be returned in an object with a single property "status", defined below.
*	<strong>RelativeGatewayUrl Connection Status Provider</strong> -	Determines if a target is online and accessible with a rest call. The result must be returned in an object with a single property "status", defined below.

### Define status

Connection Status Providers are required to return an object with a single property ```status``` that conforms to the following format:

``` json
{
    status: {
        label: string;
        type: int;
        details: string;
    }
}
```

Status properties:

* <strong>Label</strong> - A label describing the status return type. Note, values for label can be mapped in runtime. See entry below for mapping values in runtime.

* <strong>Type</strong> - The status return type. Type has the following enumeration values. For any value 2 or above, the platform will not navigate to the connected object, and an error will be displayed in the UI.

   Types:

  | Value | Description |
  | ----- | ----------- |
  | 0 | Online |
  | 1 | Warning |
  | 2 | Unauthorized |
  | 3 | Error |
  | 4 | Fatal |
  | 5 | Unknown |

* <strong>Details</strong> - Additional details describing the status return type.

### PowerShell Connection Status Provider script

The Connection Status Provider PowerShell script determines if a target is online and accessible with a PowerShell script. The result must be returned in an object with a single property "status". An example script is shown below.

Example PowerShell script:

```PowerShell
## Get-My-Status ##

function Get-Status()
{
    # A function like this would be where logic would exist to identify if a node is connectable.
    $status = @{label = $null; type = 0; details = $null; }
    $caption = "MyConstCaption"
    $productType = "MyProductType"

    # A result object needs to conform to the following object structure to be interperated properly by the Windows Admin Center shell.
    $result = @{ status = $status; caption = $caption; productType = $productType; version = $version }

    # DO FANCY LOGIC #

    # Once the logic is complete, the following fields need to be populated:
    $status.label = "Display Thing"
    $status.type = 0 # This value needs to conform to the LiveConnectionStatusType enum. >= 3 represents a failure.
    $status.details = "success stuff"

    return $result
}

Get-Status
```

### Define RelativeGatewayUrl Connection Status Provider method

The Connection Status Provider ```RelativeGatewayUrl``` method calls a rest API to determine if a target is online and accessible. The result must be returned in an object with a single property "status". An example Connection Provider entry in manifest.json of a RelativeGatewayUrl is shown below.

``` json
    {
      "entryPointType": "connectionProvider",
      "name": "addServer",
      "path": "/add/server",
      "displayName": "resources:strings:addServer_displayName",
      "icon": "sme-icon:icon-win-server",
      "description": "resources:strings:description",
      "connectionType": "msft.sme.connection-type.server",
      "connectionTypeName": "resources:strings:addServer_connectionTypeName",
      "connectionTypeUrlName": "server",
      "connectionTypeDefaultSolution": "msft.sme.server-manager!servers",
      "connectionTypeDefaultTool": "msft.sme.server-manager!overview",
      "connectionStatusProvider": {
        "relativeGatewayUrl": "<URL here post /api>",
        "displayValueMap": {
          "wmfMissing-label": "resources:strings:addServer_status_wmfMissing_label",
          "wmfMissing-details": "resources:strings:addServer_status_wmfMissing_details",
          "unsupported-label": "resources:strings:addServer_status_unsupported_label",
          "unsupported-details": "resources:strings:addServer_status_unsupported_details"
        }
      }
    },
```

Notes about using RelativeGatewayUrl:

* "relativeGatewayUrl" specifies where to get the connection status from a gateway URL. This URI is relative from /api. If $connectionName is found in the URL, it will be replaced with the name of the connection.
* All relativeGatewayUrl properties must be executed against the host gateway, which can be accomplished by creating a gateway extension

### Map values in runtime

The label and details values in the status return object can be formatted at tune time by including keys and values in the "defaultValueMap" property of the provider.

For example, if you add the value below, any time that "defaultConnection_test" showed up as a value for either label or details, Windows Admin Center will automatically replace the key with the configured resource string value.

``` json
    "defaultConnection_test": "resources:strings:addServer_status_defaultConnection_label"
```

## Implement Connection Provider in application layer

Now we're going to implement the Connection Provider in the application layer, by creating a TypeScript Class that implements OnInit. The class has the following functions:

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| constructor(private appContextService: AppContextService, private route: ActivatedRoute) |  |
| public ngOnInit() |  |
| public onSubmit() | Contains logic to update shell when an add connection attempt is made |
| public onCancel() | Contains logic to update shell when an add connection attempt is canceled |

### Define onSubmit

```onSubmit``` issues an RPC call back to the app context to notify the shell of an "Add Connection". The basic call uses "updateData" like this:

``` ts
this.appContextService.rpc.updateData(
    EnvironmentModule.nameOfShell,
    '##',
    <RpcUpdateData>{
        results: {
            connections: connections,
            credentials: this.useCredentials ? this.creds : null
        }
    }
);
```

The result is a connection property, which is an array of objects that conform to the following structure:

``` ts

/**
 * The connection attributes class.
 */
export interface ConnectionAttribute {

    /**
     * The id string of this attribute
     */
    id: string;

    /**
     * The value of the attribute. used for attributes that can have variable values such as Operating System
     */
    value?: string | number;
}

/**
 * The connection class.
 */
export interface Connection {

    /**
     * The id of the connection, this is unique per connection
     */
    id: string;

    /**
     * The type of connection
     */
    type: string;

    /**
     * The name of the connection, this is unique per connection type
     */
    name: string;

    /**
     * The property bag of the connection
     */
    properties?: ConnectionProperties;

    /**
     * The ids of attributes identified for this connection
     */
    attributes?: ConnectionAttribute[];

    /**
     * The tags the user(s) have assigned to this connection
     */
    tags?: string[];
}

/**
 * Defines connection type strings known by core
 * Be careful that these strings match what is defined by the manifest of @msft-sme/server-manager
 */
export const connectionTypeConstants = {
    server: 'msft.sme.connection-type.server',
    cluster: 'msft.sme.connection-type.cluster',
    hyperConvergedCluster: 'msft.sme.connection-type.hyper-converged-cluster',
    windowsClient: 'msft.sme.connection-type.windows-client',
    clusterNodesProperty: 'nodes'
};
```

### Define onCancel

```onCancel``` cancels an "Add Connection" attempt by passing an empty connections array:

``` ts
this.appContextService.rpc.updateData(EnvironmentModule.nameOfShell, '##', <RpcUpdateData>{ results: { connections: [] } });
```

## Connection Provider example

The full TypeScript class for implementing a connection provider is below. Note that the "connectionType" string matches the "connectionType as defined in the connection provider in manifest.json.

``` ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { AppContextService } from '@microsoft/windows-admin-center-sdk/shell/angular';
import { Connection, ConnectionUtility } from '@microsoft/windows-admin-center-sdk/shell/core';
import { EnvironmentModule } from '@microsoft/windows-admin-center-sdk/shell/dist/core/manifest/environment-modules';
import { RpcUpdateData } from '@microsoft/windows-admin-center-sdk/shell/dist/core/rpc/rpc-base';
import { Strings } from '../../generated/strings';

@Component({
  selector: 'add-example',
  templateUrl: './add-example.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./add-example.component.css']
})
export class AddExampleComponent implements OnInit {
  public newConnectionName: string;
  public strings = MsftSme.resourcesStrings<Strings>().SolutionExample;
  private connectionType = 'msft.sme.connection-type.example'; // This needs to match the connectionTypes value used in the manifest.json.

  constructor(private appContextService: AppContextService, private route: ActivatedRoute) {
    // TODO:
  }

  public ngOnInit() {
    // TODO
  }

  public onSubmit() {
    let connections: Connection[] = [];

    let connection = <Connection> {
      id: ConnectionUtility.createConnectionId(this.connectionType, this.newConnectionName),
      type: this.connectionType,
      name: this.newConnectionName
    };

    connections.push(connection);

    this.appContextService.rpc.updateData(
      EnvironmentModule.nameOfShell,
      '##',
      <RpcUpdateData> {
        results: {
          connections: connections,
          credentials: null
        }
      }
    );
  }

  public onCancel() {
    this.appContextService.rpc.updateData(
      EnvironmentModule.nameOfShell, '##', <RpcUpdateData>{ results: { connections: [] } });
  }
}

```
