# Add a module to a tool extension

>Applies To: Windows Admin Center, Windows Admin Center Preview

In this article, we will add an empty module to a tool extension we have created with the Windows Admin Center CLI.

## Prepare your environment

If you haven't already, follow the directions in develop a [tool](../develop-tool.md) (or [solution](../develop-solution.md)) extension to prepare your environment and create a new, empty tool extension.

## Use the Angular CLI to create a module (and component)

If you are new to Angular, it is highly recommended that you read the documentation on the Angular.Io website to learn about Angular and NgModule. For more information about NgModule, go here: https://angular.io/guide/ngmodule

* More information about generating a new module in Angular CLI: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-module
* More information about generating a new component in Angular CLI: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-component


Open a command prompt, change directory to .\src\app in your project, then run the following commands, replacing ```{!ModuleName}``` with your module name (spaces removed):

```
cd .\src\app
ng generate module {!ModuleName}
ng generate component {!ModuleName}
```

| Value | Explanation | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| ```{!ModuleName}``` | Your module name (spaces removed) | ```ManageFooWorksPortal``` |

Example usage:
```
cd .\src\app
ng generate module ManageFooWorksPortal
ng generate component ManageFooWorksPortal
```


## Add routing information

If you are new to Angular, it is highly recommended you learn about Angular Routing and Navigation. The sections below define necessary routing elements that enable Windows Admin Center to navigate to your extension and between views in your extension in response to user activity. To learn more, go here: https://angular.io/guide/router

Use the same module name that you used in the step above.

### Add content to new routing file

* Browse to the module folder that was created by  ``` ng generate ``` in the previous step.

* Create a new file ```{!module-name}.routing.ts```, following this naming convention:

    | Value | Explanation | Example filename |
    | ----- | ----------- | ------- |
    | ```{!module-name}``` | Your module name (lower case, spaces replaced with dashes) | ```manage-foo-works-portal.routing.ts``` |

* Add this content to the file just created:

    ``` ts
    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
    import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
    import { {!ModuleName}Component } from './{!module-name}.component';

    const routes: Routes = [
        {
            path: '',
            component: {!ModuleName}Component,
            // if the component has child components that need to be routed to, include them in the children array.
            children: [
                {
                    path: '',
                    redirectTo: 'base',
                    pathMatch: 'full'
                }
            ]
    }];

    @NgModule({
        imports: [
            RouterModule.forChild(routes)
        ],
        exports: [
            RouterModule
        ]
    })
    export class Routing { }
    ```

* Replace values in the file just created with your desired values:

    | Value | Explanation | Example |
    | ----- | ----------- | ------- |
    | ```{!ModuleName}``` | Your module name (spaces removed) | ```ManageFooWorksPortal``` |
    | ```{!module-name}``` | Your module name (lower case, spaces replaced with dashes) | ```manage-foo-works-portal``` |

### Add content to new module file

Open file ```{!module-name}.module.ts```, found with the following naming convention:

| Value | Explanation | Example filename |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| ```{!module-name}``` | Your module name (lower case, spaces replaced with dashes) | ```manage-foo-works-portal.module.ts``` |

* Add content to the file:

    ``` ts
    import { Routing } from './{!module-name}.routing';
    ```

* Replace values in the content just added with your desired values:

    | Value | Explanation | Example |
    | ----- | ----------- | ------- |
    | ```{!module-name}``` | Your module name (lower case, spaces replaced with dashes) | ```manage-foo-works-portal``` |

* Modify the imports statement to import Routing:

    | Original value | New value |
    | -------------- | --------- |
    | ```imports: [ CommonModule ]``` | ```imports: [ CommonModule, Routing ]``` |

* Make sure ```import``` statements are alphabetized by source.

### Add content to new component typescript file

Open file ```{!module-name}.component.ts```, found with the following naming convention:

| Value | Explanation | Example filename |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| ```{!module-name}``` | Your module name (lower case, spaces replaced with dashes) | ```manage-foo-works-portal.component.ts``` |

Modify content in the file to the following:

``` ts
constructor() {
    // TODO
}

public ngOnInit() {
    // TODO
}
```
### Update app-routing.module.ts

Open file ```app-routing.module.ts```, and modify the default path so it will load the new module you just created.  Find the entry for ```path: ''```, and update  ```loadChildren``` to load your module instead of the default module:

| Value | Explanation | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| ```{!ModuleName}``` | Your module name (spaces removed) | ```ManageFooWorksPortal``` |
| ```{!module-name}``` | Your module name (lower case, spaces replaced with dashes) | ```manage-foo-works-portal``` |

``` ts
    {
        path: '',
        loadChildren: 'app/{!module-name}/{!module-name}.module#{!ModuleName}Module'
    },
```
Here's an example of an updated default path:
``` ts
    {
        path: '',
        loadChildren: 'app/manage-foo-works-portal/manage-foo-works-portal.module#ManageFooWorksPortalModule'
    },
```


## Build and side load your extension

You've now added a module to your extension.  Next, you can [build and side load](../develop-tool.md#build-and-side-load-your-extension) your extension in Windows Admin Center to see the results.
