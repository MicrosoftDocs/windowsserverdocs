## Enable and disable a capability

Each capability can be enabled or disabled. Disabling a capability prevents that capability from being invoked, and for non-default capabilities, disabling a capability stops all data collection for that capability. By default, all capabilities are enabled, and you can check the state of a capability before changing it.

### [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

To enable a capability, use the **Enable-InsightsCapability** cmdlet:

1. Open PowerShell, and enter the following command replacing the name of the capability with the capability of your choice.

    ```PowerShell
    Enable-InsightsCapability -Name "CPU capacity forecasting"
    ```

To disable a capability, use the **Disable-InsightsCapability** cmdlet:

1. Open PowerShell, and enter the following command replacing the name of the capability with the capability of your choice.

    ```PowerShell
    Disable-InsightsCapability -Name "Networking capacity forecasting"
    ```

1. You're prompted to confirm the capability you're disabling.

    [ ![Screenshot of using the Disable-InsightsCapability cmdlet in PowerShell.](media/disable-insights-capability.png) ](media/disable-insights-capability.png#lightbox)

### [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windows-admin-center)

These settings can be toggled by selecting a capability in Windows Admin Center.

To enable a capability:

1. Open the **Systems Insights** extension.
1. Select the row of the capability you want to enable.
1. Select **Enable** in the top menu.
1. The capability is enabled.

    [ ![Screenshot showing how to enable a capability in Windows Admin Center.](media/enable-capability.png) ](media/enable-capability.png#lightbox)

To disable a capability:

### Invoke a capability

Invoking a capability immediately runs the capability to retrieve a prediction, and administrators can invoke a capability any time in Windows Admin Center, or by using the **Invoke-InsightsCapability** cmdlet. To make sure invoking a capability doesn't conflict with critical operations on your machine, consider scheduling predictions during off-business hours.

### [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

1. Open PowerShell, and enter the following command replacing the name of the capability with the capability of your choice.

    ```PowerShell
    Invoke-InsightsCapability -Name "CPU capacity forecasting"
    ```

1. Confirm that you want to invoke the capability.

    [ ![Screenshot of using the Invoke-InsightsCapability cmdlet in PowerShell.](media/invoke-insights-capability.png) ](media/invoke-insights-capability.png#lightbox)

### [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windows-admin-center)

1. Open the **Systems Insights** extension.

1. Select the row of the capability you want to invoke.

1. Select the **Invoke** button in Windows Admin Center.

    [ ![Screenshot showing how to invoke the CPU capacity forecasting capability.](media/invoke-cpu-capacity-forecasting.png) ](media/invoke-cpu-capacity-forecasting.png#lightbox)

1. A notification appears and shows the capability was successfully invoked.

## Retrieve capability results

### [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

Once a capability is invoked, the most recent results are visible using **Get-InsightsCapability** or **Get-InsightsCapabilityResult**. These cmdlets output the most recent **Status** and **Status Description** of each capability, which describe the result of each prediction. The **Status** and **Status Description** fields are further described in the [understanding capabilities document](understanding-capabilities.md).

Additionally, you can use the **Get-InsightsCapabilityResult** cmdlet to view the last 30 prediction results and to retrieve the data associated with the prediction:

```PowerShell
# Specify the History parameter to see the last 30 prediction results.
Get-InsightsCapabilityResult -Name "CPU capacity forecasting" -History

# Use the Output field to locate and then show the results of "CPU capacity forecasting."
# Specify the encoding as UTF8, so that Get-Content correctly parses non-English characters.
$Output = Get-Content (Get-InsightsCapabilityResult -Name "CPU capacity forecasting").Output -Encoding UTF8 | ConvertFrom-Json
$Output.ForecastingResults
```

### [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windows-admin-center)

The System Insights extension automatically shows the prediction history and parses the results of the JSON result, giving you an intuitive, high-fidelity graph of each forecast:

### Use the event log to retrieve capability results

System Insights logs an event each time a capability finishes a prediction. These events are visible in the **Microsoft-Windows-System-Insights/Admin** channel, and System Insights publishes a different event ID for each status:

| Prediction status | Event ID |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Ok | 151 |
| Warning | 148 |
| Critical | 150 |
| Error | 149 |
| None | 132 |

Use [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor/) or [System Center Operations Manager](/system-center/scom/welcome) to aggregate these events and see prediction results across a group of machines.

## Set a capability schedule

In addition to on-demand predictions, you can configure periodic predictions for each capability so that the specified capability is automatically invoked on a predefined schedule. Each default capability is scheduled to run every day at 3am. You can, however, create custom schedules for each capability, and System Insights supports a variety of schedule types.

### [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

Use the **Get-InsightsCapabilitySchedule** cmdlet to see capability schedules. Use the pipeline `|` in PowerShell to see information for all capabilities returned by the **Get-InsightsCapability** cmdlet.

```PowerShell
Get-InsightsCapability | Get-InsightsCapabilitySchedule
```

Periodic predictions are enabled by default though they can be disabled at any time using the **Enable-InsightsCapabilitySchedule** and **Disable-InsightsCapabilitySchedule** cmdlets:

```PowerShell
Enable-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "Total storage consumption forecasting"
Disable-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "Volume consumption forecasting"
```

You can create custom schedules for each capability using the **Set-InsightsCapabilitySchedule** cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Set-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "CPU capacity forecasting" -Daily -DaysInterval 2 -At 4:00PM
Set-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "Networking capacity forecasting" -Daily -DaysOfWeek Saturday, Sunday -At 2:30AM
Set-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "Total storage consumption forecasting" -Hourly -HoursInterval 2 -DaysOfWeek Monday, Wednesday, Friday
Set-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "Volume consumption forecasting" -Minute -MinutesInterval 30
```

Because the default capabilities analyze daily data, it's recommended to use daily schedules for these capabilities. Learn more about the [default capabilities](understanding-capabilities.md).

### [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windows-admin-center)

You can also use Windows Admin Center to view and set schedules for each capability.

1. Select the name of the capability you want to schedule.
1. Select **Settings** on the capability overview page.
1. The **Schedule** tab shows the current schedule, and can be updated to run on a different schedule.

## Create remediation actions

System Insights enables you to kick off custom remediation scripts based on the result of a capability. For each capability, you can configure a custom PowerShell script for each prediction status, allowing administrators to take corrective action automatically, rather than requiring manual intervention.

Sample remediation actions include running disk cleanup, extending a volume, running deduplication, live migrating VMs, and setting up Azure File Sync.

### [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

You can see the actions for each capability using the **Get-InsightsCapabilityAction** cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Get-InsightsCapability | Get-InsightsCapabilityAction
```

You can create new actions or delete existing actions using the **Set-InsightsCapabilityAction** and **Remove-InsightsCapabilityAction** cmdlets. Each action is run using credentials that are specified in the **ActionCredential** parameter.

```PowerShell
$Cred = Get-Credential
Set-InsightsCapabilityAction -Name "CPU capacity forecasting" -Type Warning -Action "C:\Users\Public\WarningScript.ps1" -ActionCredential $Cred
Set-InsightsCapabilityAction -Name "CPU capacity forecasting" -Type Critical -Action "C:\Users\Public\CriticalScript.ps1" -ActionCredential $Cred

Remove-InsightsCapabilityAction -Name "CPU capacity forecasting" -Type Warning
```

### [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windows-admin-center)

You can also use Windows Admin Center to set remediation actions.

1. Select the name of the capability you want to specify actions for.
1. Select **Settings** on the capability overview page.
1. The **Actions** tab shows the current actions. Browse example scripts, set scripts to run for each status, and enter credentials in this tab.
