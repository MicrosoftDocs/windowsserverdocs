# Managing capabilities

>Applies To: Windows Server 2019

In Windows Server 2019, System Insights exposes a variety of settings that can be configured for each capability, and these settings can be tuned to address the specific needs of your deployment. This topic describes how to manage the various settings for each capability through Windows Admin Center or PowerShell, providing basic PowerShell examples and Windows Admin Center screenshots to demonstrate how to adjust these settings.

>[!TIP]
>You can also use these short videos to help you get started and confidently manage System Insights: [Getting started with System Insights in 10 minutes](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/filecab/2018/07/24/getting-started-with-system-insights-in-10-minutes/)

Though this section provides PowerShell examples, you can use the [System Insights PowerShell documentation](/powershell/module/systeminsights/) to see all of the cmdlets, parameters, and parameter sets within System Insights.

## Viewing capabilities

To get started, you can list all of the available capabilities using the **Get-InsightsCapability** cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Get-InsightsCapability
```
These capabilities are also visible in System Insights extension:

## Enabling and disabling a capability
Each capability can be enabled or disabled. Disabling a capability prevents that capability from being invoked, and for non-default capabilities, disabling a capability stops all data collection for that capability. By default, all capabilities are enabled, and you can check the state of a capability using the **Get-InsightsCapability** cmdlet.

To enable or disable a capability, use the **Enable-InsightsCapability** and the **Disable-InsightsCapability** cmdlets:

```PowerShell
Enable-InsightsCapability -Name "CPU capacity forecasting"
Disable-InsightsCapability -Name "Networking capacity forecasting"
```
These settings can also be toggled by selected a capability in Windows Admin Center clicking the **Enable** or **Disable** buttons.

### Invoking a capability
Invoking a capability immediately runs the capability to retrieve a prediction, and administrators can invoke a capability any time by clicking the **Invoke** button in Windows Admin Center or by using the **Invoke-InsightsCapability** cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Invoke-InsightsCapability -Name "CPU capacity forecasting"
```

>[!TIP]
>To make sure invoking a capability doesn't conflict with critical operations on your machine, consider scheduling predictions during off-business hours.

## Retrieving capability results
Once a capability has been invoked, the most recent results are visible using **Get-InsightsCapability** or **Get-InsightsCapabilityResult**. These cmdlets output the most recent **Status** and **Status Description** of each capability, which describe the result of each prediction. The **Status** and **Status Description** fields are further described in the [understanding capabilities document](understanding-capabilities.md).

Additionally, you can use the **Get-InsightsCapabilityResult** cmdlet to view the last 30 prediction results and to retrieve the data associated with the prediction:

```PowerShell
# Specify the History parameter to see the last 30 prediction results.
Get-InsightsCapabilityResult -Name "CPU capacity forecasting" -History

# Use the Output field to locate and then show the results of "CPU capacity forecasting."
# Specify the encoding as UTF8, so that Get-Content correctly parses non-English characters.
$Output = Get-Content (Get-InsightsCapabilityResult -Name "CPU capacity forecasting").Output -Encoding UTF8 | ConvertFrom-Json
$Output.ForecastingResults
```
The System Insights extension automatically shows the prediction history and parses the results of the JSON result, giving you an intuitive, high-fidelity graph of each forecast:

### Using the event log to retrieve capability results
System Insights logs an event each time a capability finishes a prediction. These events are visible in the **Microsoft-Windows-System-Insights/Admin** channel, and System Insights publishes a different event ID for each status:

| Prediction status | Event ID |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Ok | 151 |
| Warning | 148 |
| Critical | 150 |
| Error | 149 |
| None | 132 |

>[!TIP]
>Use [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor/) or [System Center Operations Manager](/system-center/scom/welcome?view=sc-om-1807&preserve-view=true) to aggregate these events and see prediction results across a group of machines.


## Setting a capability schedule
In addition to on-demand predictions, you can configure periodic predictions for each capability so that the specified capability is automatically invoked on a predefined schedule. Use the **Get-InsightsCapabilitySchedule** cmdlet to see capability schedules:

>[!TIP]
>Use the pipeline operator in PowerShell to see information for all capabilities returned by the **Get-InsightsCapability** cmdlet.

```PowerShell
Get-InsightsCapability | Get-InsightsCapabilitySchedule
```

Periodic predictions are enabled by default though they can be disabled at any time using the **Enable-InsightsCapabilitySchedule** and **Disable-InsightsCapabilitySchedule** cmdlets:

```PowerShell
Enable-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "Total storage consumption forecasting"
Disable-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "Volume consumption forecasting"
```

Each default capability is scheduled to run every day at 3am. You can, however, create custom schedules for each capability, and System Insights supports a variety of schedule types, which can be configured using the **Set-InsightsCapabilitySchedule** cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Set-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "CPU capacity forecasting" -Daily -DaysInterval 2 -At 4:00PM
Set-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "Networking capacity forecasting" -Daily -DaysOfWeek Saturday, Sunday -At 2:30AM
Set-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "Total storage consumption forecasting" -Hourly -HoursInterval 2 -DaysOfWeek Monday, Wednesday, Friday
Set-InsightsCapabilitySchedule -Name "Volume consumption forecasting" -Minute -MinutesInterval 30
```
>[!NOTE]
>Because the default capabilities analyze daily data, it's recommended to use daily schedules for these capabilities. Learn more about the default capabilities [here](understanding-capabilities.md).

You can also use Windows Admin Center to view and set schedules for each capability by clicking **Settings**. The current schedule is shown on the **Schedule** tab, and you can use the GUI tools to create a new schedule:

![Settings page showing current schedule](media/schedule-page-contoso.png)

## Creating remediation actions
System Insights enables you to kick off custom remediation scripts based on the result of a capability. For each capability, you can configure a custom PowerShell script for each prediction status, allowing administrators to take corrective action automatically, rather than requiring manual intervention.

Sample remediation actions include running disk cleanup, extending a volume, running deduplication, live migrating VMs, and setting up Azure File Sync.

You can see the actions for each capability using the **Get-InsightsCapabilityAction** cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Get-InsightsCapability | Get-InsightsCapabilityAction
```

You can create new actions or delete existing actions using the **Set-InsightsCapabilityAction** and **Remove-InsightsCapabilityAction** cmdlets. Each action is run using credentials that are specified in the **ActionCredential** parameter.

>[!NOTE]
>In the initial System Insights release, you must specify remediation scripts outside of user directories. This will be fixed in an upcoming release.

```PowerShell
$Cred = Get-Credential
Set-InsightsCapabilityAction -Name "CPU capacity forecasting" -Type Warning -Action "C:\Users\Public\WarningScript.ps1" -ActionCredential $Cred
Set-InsightsCapabilityAction -Name "CPU capacity forecasting" -Type Critical -Action "C:\Users\Public\CriticalScript.ps1" -ActionCredential $Cred

Remove-InsightsCapabilityAction -Name "CPU capacity forecasting" -Type Warning
```

You can also use Windows Admin Center to set remediation actions by using the **Actions** tab within the **Settings** page:
