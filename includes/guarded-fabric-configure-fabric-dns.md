There are many ways to configure name resolution for the fabric domain. 
One simple way is to set up a conditional forwarder zone in DNS for the fabric. 
To set up this zone, run the following commands in an elevated Windows PowerShell console on a fabric DNS server. 
Substitute the names and addresses in the Windows PowerShell syntax below as needed for your environment. 
Add master servers for the additional HGS nodes.

```
Add-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone -Name 'bastion.local' -ReplicationScope "Forest" -MasterServers <IP addresses of HGS server>
```
