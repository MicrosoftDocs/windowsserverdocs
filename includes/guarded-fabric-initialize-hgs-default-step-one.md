Clients can easily contact any HGS node by using the failover clustering distributed network name (DNN). 
You'll need to choose a DNN. 
This name will be registered in the HGS DNS service. 
As an example, if you have 3 HGS nodes with hostnames HGS01, HGS02, and HGS03, you might decide to choose "hgs" or "HgsCluster" for the DNN.
