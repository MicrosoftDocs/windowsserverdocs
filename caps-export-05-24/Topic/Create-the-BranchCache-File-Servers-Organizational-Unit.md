You can use this procedure to create an organizational unit \(OU\) in Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) for BranchCache file servers.  
  
Membership in **Domain Admins**, or equivalent is the minimum required to perform this procedure.  
  
### To create the BranchCache file servers organizational unit

2.  In the Active Directory Users and Computers console, right\-click the domain to which you want to add an OU. For example, if your domain is named example.com, right click **example.com**. Point to **New**, and then click **Organizational Unit**. The **New Object – Organizational Unit** dialog box opens.  
  
3.  In the **New Object – Organizational Unit** dialog box, in **Name**, type a name for the new OU. For example, if you want to name the OU BranchCache file servers, type **BranchCache file servers**, and then click **OK**.
