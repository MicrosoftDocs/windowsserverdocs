# Audit Registry
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit Registry**, which determines whether the operating system generates audit events when users attempt to access registry objects.  
  
Audit events are generated only for objects that have configured system access control lists \(SACLs\) specified, and only if the type of access requested \(such as Write, Read, or Modify\) and the account making the request match the settings in the SACL.  
  
If success auditing is enabled, an audit entry is generated each time any account successfully accesses a registry object that has a matching SACL. If failure auditing is enabled, an audit entry is generated each time any user unsuccessfully attempts to access a registry object that has a matching SACL.  
  
Event volume: Low to medium, depending on how registry SACLs are configured  
  
Default: Not configured  
  
If this policy setting is configured, the following events appear on computers running the supported versions of the Windows operating system as designated in the **Applies to** list at the beginning of this topic, in addition to Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.  
  
|Event ID|Event message|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|4657|A registry value was modified.|  
|5039|A registry key was virtualized.|
